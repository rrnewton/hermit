# Remove computed demo results so the next run starts fresh.
#
# Demos 5 and 6 save the result of their first run (demo 5: boot-anchor/;
# demo 6: resume-metadata/) and compare every later run against it. After
# the Hermit binary, the kernel, or a demo changes, that saved result no
# longer applies, and later runs report PARTIAL. Clean it away with:
#
#   ./clean.sh              remove computed results: saved first runs, run
#                           history, snapshots, logs, and runtime files.
#                           Keeps the downloaded kernel and built initramfs.
#   ./clean.sh --distclean  also remove the downloaded kernel and the built
#                           initramfs (bzImage, initramfs.cpio.gz, vmlinux).
#   ./clean.sh --dry-run    print what would be removed without deleting.
#
# The QEMU asset directory defaults to <repo>/ignored/qemu-linux, or to a
# checkout-specific /var/tmp directory when the checkout is under /tmp, and
# honors the same QEMU_ASSETS override the demos use. Only paths the demos
# create are removed.
#
# A results directory moved with DEMO07_ARTIFACTS, DEMO08_ARTIFACTS or
# DEMO_SWEEP_LOG_DIR is not removed: such a path can name any directory, and
# nothing records which entries in it a demo created. clean.sh prints its
# name instead, so that you can remove it yourself.
