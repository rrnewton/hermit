prepare-assets.sh -- build demo 8's AddressSanitizer btrfs-convert variants

USAGE:
  demos/08-btrfs-convert-uaf/prepare-assets.sh            build the assets and find a crashing seed
  demos/08-btrfs-convert-uaf/prepare-assets.sh -h|--help  show this help and exit

A bare invocation clones btrfs-progs v7.1, builds the buggy and fixed variants
with AddressSanitizer, creates a small ext4 image, and then runs `hermit run
--chaos` over seeds until one crashes, crashes again with the same complete
AddressSanitizer report, and is clean with the fixed variant. It records that
seed in <assets>/.crash-seed. It is idempotent: when the cached assets match
the sources it only re-checks the recorded seed.

Needs: hermit on PATH, autoconf, automake, file, git, make, mkfs.ext4 (e2fsprogs),
patch, pkg-config, truncate, a C compiler with AddressSanitizer, and network
access to github.com.

Env: DEMO08_DIR (assets), DEMO08_BUILD_ROOT, DEMO08_ARTIFACTS, DEMO08_BTRFS_REPO,
DEMO08_BUILD_JOBS, DEMO08_CALIBRATION_SEEDS (default 64), DEMO08_TIMEOUT (the
demo's per-run timeout, default 90, which also caps each calibration run),
DEMO08_CALIBRATION_TIMEOUT (must not exceed DEMO08_TIMEOUT), and
DEMO08_REFUSAL_RETRIES (default 2: how many more times to run a seed when
Hermit refuses a run with exit status 122; a seed refused on every attempt is
reported as refused and skipped, not counted as tested).
