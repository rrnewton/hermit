# Demo 8: a real, schedule-dependent use-after-free in btrfs-convert.
#
# btrfs-convert runs a background "progress" thread that reads a shared
# `struct task_info *info` while the main thread copies inodes. Before upstream
# commit 73e211a7, task_start() detached that thread and task_stop() never
# joined it, so task_deinit() could free(info) while the thread was still
# reading it. Whether that happens depends only on the teardown interleaving,
# which an ordinary run cannot choose. Hermit's chaos scheduler reaches the
# crashing interleaving on specific seeds and reproduced the crash in every run
# counted in README.md.
#
# The demo runs AddressSanitizer builds of two btrfs-convert variants: `buggy`
# (before 73e211a7) and `fixed` (73e211a7). It reports what one native buggy run
# showed, then shows that the chaos buggy run crashes on a known seed, the chaos
# fixed run on the same seed is clean, and a second run of the seed prints the
# same complete AddressSanitizer report, byte for byte, from its ERROR line
# through its closing ABORTING line. That held on the host described in
# README.md, which gives the host's load where it was recorded. If a
# performance-counter interrupt arrives later than Hermit's safety margin, which
# heavy host load makes more likely, Reverie prints a HERMIT_SKID_OVERSHOOT line
# and Hermit refuses the run: it prints "HERMIT_POLICY_REFUSAL
# class=policy-refusal cause=skid-overshoot count=N" and exits 122, so this
# script reports rc=122 instead of the expected crash. README.md explains this.
# prepare-assets.sh builds the binaries and the input image; WRITEUP.md tells
# the story of the bug.

Usage: demos/08-btrfs-convert-uaf/run.sh

Show a schedule-dependent btrfs-convert use-after-free that native execution
cannot reproduce on demand and `hermit run --chaos` finds and reproduces; the
README counts the runs in which it did and gives the host's load where it was
recorded. Under heavy host load a late performance-counter interrupt makes
Hermit refuse a run (HERMIT_POLICY_REFUSAL ... cause=skid-overshoot, exit 122),
and this script then reports rc=122; see demos/08-btrfs-convert-uaf/README.md.

Needs AddressSanitizer btrfs-convert binaries and a populated ext4 image, which
demos/08-btrfs-convert-uaf/prepare-assets.sh builds:
  ignored/demo08-btrfs/buggy/btrfs-convert
  ignored/demo08-btrfs/fixed/btrfs-convert
  ignored/demo08-btrfs/pop-tiny.img
When those assets are absent the demo prints SKIPPED and exits 0.

Useful overrides:
  DEMO08_DIR=/path        asset directory (buggy/, fixed/, pop-tiny.img)
  DEMO08_ARTIFACTS=/path  per-run scratch images and saved ASAN reports
  DEMO08_CRASH_SEED=N     use this seed instead of the one prepare-assets.sh recorded
  DEMO08_TIMEOUT=90       per-run timeout in seconds; prepare-assets.sh reads the
                          same variable, so it only records a seed that fits here
  DEMO08_REQUIRE_ASSETS=1 fail instead of skipping when assets are absent
