# Demo 6: Resume the Linux snapshot and run a command

Booting Linux under Hermit took 75.7 seconds for one `make -C demos demo5` on
a shared 316-CPU host (2026-09-30, Hermit 0.2.0 gdc92644f96f4, QEMU 10.1.2; see
demo 5). On the same host, restoring the saved machine and running one command
took 15.7 to 16.5 seconds of Hermit/QEMU time over eleven resumes, or 10.0 to
11.4 seconds over three resumes that did not save a post-command snapshot. One
`make -C demos demo6` took 25.3 seconds (demo 6 took 26 seconds inside a
`make -C demos group3`), and four first invocations of a command, which resume
twice, took 46.0 to 46.4 seconds. This demo restores the snapshot that
[demo 5](../05-qemu-boot/README.md) saved, has the already-running guest shell
run one command, prints the command's output, and saves the machine again after
the command. Because the resumed machine runs under Hermit, running the same
command again produces identical guest output and a byte-identical
post-command snapshot.

## Prerequisites

- Everything [demo 5](../05-qemu-boot/README.md#prerequisites) needs.
- The boot snapshot from demo 5. If it is missing, this demo runs demo 5 first.

The resume itself does not use the hardware performance counters (see "How it
works"), but demo 5 does if it has to run first.

## Run it

From the repository root:

```bash
demos/06-qemu-resume/run.py
```

With no argument the guest runs `uname -a`. Pass any single-line shell command
of up to 511 bytes to run it inside the guest instead:

```bash
demos/06-qemu-resume/run.py 'ls /'
demos/06-qemu-resume/run.py 'cat /proc/meminfo | head -n 3'
```

The guest reads only the first 512 bytes of the disk that carries its command,
and the newline after the command has to fit in them too, so `run.py` refuses a
longer command (counted in UTF-8 bytes) before it resumes anything.

`make -C demos demo6` runs the default command, and
`make -C demos demo6 DEMO6_COMMAND='ls /'` runs another simple one. Quote a
command that contains shell syntax such as `|` and pass it to `run.py`
directly, because Make would otherwise hand the `|` to your own shell.

Each distinct command has its own reference run. On the first run of a command,
one invocation resumes twice: the first resume is saved as that command's
reference and the second is compared with it. Set `QEMU_RESUME_REPEAT=0` to
resume only once; that invocation then compares nothing, ends with
`FIRST RUN SAVED`, and still exits 0. `demos/run-all.sh`, which
`make -C demos all` and the group targets use, sets `QEMU_RESUME_REPEAT=1`, so
it always resumes a second time to compare.

## What you will see

Captured on 2026-09-30: the second resume of a first `uname -a` invocation,
with the tail of Hermit's log cut (marked `...`).

This capture and the 2026-09-30 measurements below predate the 2026-10-02
change to the guest's `/init` that frames the command's output (see "How it
works"). A run of the current demo also prints `Guest command exit status: 0`
after the guest output and `PASS: guest command exit status matches (0)` in
the repeat check, and its post-command snapshot hash, scheduler turns, virtual
times, and log size are expected to differ from the figures here. The sample
is to be refreshed from the next verified run.

=== Demo 6: QEMU Snapshot Resume: SUCCESS ===
```

Elided (`...`): your Hermit version and path, the tail of Hermit's log, the
QEMU package name and binary hash, and the per-run directory names (a
timestamp and a process ID). The wall-clock times (`16.3s`) depend on host
load; in a terminal the `Hermit/QEMU resume` counter updates in place until it
reads `done`. The `PASS: Hermit INFO log` line is shown in the current
comparator's wording; the capture printed an earlier comparator's wording. Its
logs pass the current comparison too: they differed in no line once the
wall-clock prefix was removed (see below). The directory named `28ba533b...`
is the SHA-256 of the command string `uname -a`. Your hashes and virtual times
will match these only with the same QEMU build, kernel and demo 5 snapshot. As
in demo 5, a saved reference run no longer applies after you rebuild Hermit,
change QEMU or the kernel, replace demo 5's snapshot, change the guest's
`/init` or initramfs (`demos/lib/qemu-assets.sh`; demo 5 must then save a new
boot snapshot), edit `demos/lib/demo_common.py` or
`demos/lib/qemu_controller.py`, or run the demo with a different Python
interpreter: the interpreter that runs `run.py` is also the guest's controller
program. Run `demos/clean.sh` to start over.

On 2026-09-30 six `uname -a` resumes ran: two in a first invocation in this
checkout, one `make -C demos demo6`, one `make -C demos group3`, and two in a
first invocation from a copy of the `demos` directory under `/var/tmp`. In all
six the post-command snapshot, the guest output, the scheduler's 288022 turns,
the virtual times, and the whole Hermit log (258,506,138 bytes, 1,604,193
lines) were identical;
the logs differed in no line once each line's leading wall-clock timestamp was
removed. The other two commands behaved the same way: `ls /` (three resumes)
gave post-command snapshot `146f380f...` and guest output `81acdc95...`, and
`cat /proc/meminfo | head -n 3` (two resumes) gave `642d32db...` and
`a78a631c...`.

The first resume of a new command ends instead with:

=== Demo 6: QEMU Snapshot Resume: FIRST RUN SAVED ===

```

## What to notice

- The guest did not boot. The kernel messages from demo 5 do not appear; the
  guest continues from the exact moment the snapshot was taken and runs the
  command straight away.
- Where demo 5's repeat check has a `serial output SHA-256` line, this one has
  `guest output SHA-256`: the output of your command, taken from the serial
  transcript between the guest's BEGIN and END lines with the `| ` in front of
  each line removed (see "How it works"). The demo does not hash the rest of
  the transcript; we compared each run's archived `serial.log` by hand, and it
  was byte-identical across the repeats of each command above.
- `Guest command exit status:` is the command's own exit status, read from the
  guest's END line. It is saved in `run-metadata.json` as `guest_exit_status`
  and compared with the reference run (`PASS: guest command exit status
  matches`). A nonzero status does not fail the demo, because it is the
  command's result; a status that differs from the reference run does.
- The reference run is stored per command (under a directory named after the
  command's SHA-256), so `uname -a` and `ls /` are checked independently.
- As in demo 5, one value in the Hermit log still depends on how `hermit` was
  started. QEMU reads `/proc/self/status`, and Hermit passes that file's
  `SigIgn` line, the set of signals the process ignores, through from the host
  unchanged: https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3441. On 2026-09-30, in
  two invocations from a fresh clone, the only failed comparison was the second
  resume of the first invocation: QEMU's two reads of `/proc/self/status`
  differed in the bit for signal 33, while the post-command snapshot and the
  guest output matched. The second resume came after the demo's first thread,
  and glibc changes signal 33 when a program creates its first thread;
  [demo 5's "How it works"](../05-qemu-boot/README.md#how-it-works) explains
  this. The demo now starts and waits for one thread before its first resume,
  so every resume sees signal 33 in the same state. Other signals that a
  launcher leaves ignored still pass through to the guest. `nohup`, for
  example, ignores `SIGHUP`, and GNU `make` also leaves signal 32, glibc's other
  internal signal, ignored. glibc resets signal 32 only when a program cancels
  a thread, which the demo never does, so on a host where `python3` is a plain
  binary, `make -C demos demo6` and `demos/06-qemu-resume/run.py` from a shell
  can still start `hermit` with different values. So start the reference run
  and the repeats the
  same way (for example, always `make -C demos demo6`, or always
  `demos/06-qemu-resume/run.py` from a shell), and run `demos/clean.sh` when you
  switch. The comparison does not ignore this field. If a `PARTIAL` run's only
  `WARN:` is the Hermit log, check whether the differing lines are QEMU's reads
  of `/proc/self/status`.
- `--no-save-snapshot` skips saving the post-command snapshot; the guest output
  and the Hermit log are still compared, and the `qcow2 SHA-256` and
  `DETERMINISTIC:` lines do not appear. Such a run keeps its own reference, in
  the command's directory name with `-no-save-snapshot` appended, because it
  executes differently (194491 scheduler turns for `uname -a` instead of
  288022, a 169,751,813-byte Hermit log, identical in three resumes). For
  example:

  ```bash
  demos/06-qemu-resume/run.py --no-save-snapshot 'uname -a'
  ```

## How it works

The demo copies the boot snapshot and starts QEMU with the same machine
configuration as demo 5, plus an option to load the `hermit-boot` snapshot at
start-up. The command travels to the guest on a small raw disk, `/dev/vda`,
that demo 5 attached (holding `WAIT`) before it saved the snapshot. Before QEMU
starts, the demo writes the command into that disk image. When the guest
resumes, its `/init` loop reads the disk's first 512 bytes, finds a command
instead of `WAIT`, and runs it. The command is on disk before the guest runs,
so nothing depends on when the host sends it.

`/init` frames the command's output so that nothing the command prints can be
taken for the frame. It prints `__HERMIT_COMMAND_BEGIN__ format=3`, then runs
the command as user and group 1000 (BusyBox `chpst -u 1000:1000`), with its
standard input from `/dev/null` and its standard output and standard error
going to a file. It prints that file with `| ` in front of every line and every
byte 0x01 (ASCII SOH) removed, and then prints `__HERMIT_COMMAND_END__`, one
0x01 byte, and `status=N`, where `N` is the command's exit status. The
controller ([`lib/qemu_controller.py`](../lib/qemu_controller.py)) reads the
transcript line by line and accepts only these exact whole lines as the frame.
A command that prints the end marker itself, for example
`echo __HERMIT_COMMAND_END__; echo FINISHED; exit 3`, shows it as the output
line `| __HERMIT_COMMAND_END__`, followed by `| FINISHED`, and the demo
reports exit status 3 from the real END line after them. A command that never
exits, for example `echo __HERMIT_COMMAND_END__; sleep 1000000`, shows
nothing: `/init` prints the output only after the command exits, so neither
its output nor an END line reaches the serial port, and the run fails when a
bound stops it (see "A run that does not finish" below).

The command cannot print a frame line by another route either:

- It cannot write to the serial port. `/dev/console` and `/dev/ttyS0` belong to
  root with mode 0600, and the command is not root. Its standard input is
  `/dev/null`, so it holds no console file descriptor: before this change the
  command inherited `/init`'s standard input, the console opened for reading
  and writing, and `echo ... >&0` put a forged END line straight on the serial
  port.
- It cannot make the kernel print one. `/dev/kmsg` has mode 0644, so user 1000
  cannot write to it, and the kernel command line holds `printk.time=1`, so
  every line the kernel prints starts with a `[` timestamp.
- It cannot change what `/init` prints. No output line holds a 0x01 byte, so
  neither an output line nor the tail of one that a kernel message split in
  two is an END line. User 1000 cannot signal or trace `/init`, and because
  `/tmp` is sticky (mode 1777) it cannot remove or rename the output file,
  which `/init` creates as root; writing into that file only changes its own
  output.

This rests on the guest kernel. A kernel bug or privilege escalation that
gives user 1000 root, or a kernel or initramfs other than demo 5's with
different device modes, would reopen these routes; the demo does not defend
against the guest kernel. When the real END line arrives, the controller asks QEMU to save a
snapshot named `command-<first 16 hex digits of the command's SHA-256>`. The
demo removes the `| ` prefixes to get the guest output. Any other line inside
the frame, such as a kernel message, is kept in the guest output with
`[console] ` in front of it, so it is shown and compared rather than dropped.

The framing has these consequences and limits:

- The output appears after the command has exited, not while it runs.
- The command's standard output is a file, not the console. Programs that
  format for a terminal print differently (BusyBox `ls`, for example, prints
  one name per line instead of columns), and C programs buffer their standard
  output, so its lines can come out in a different order relative to standard
  error than they would at a terminal.
- The command runs as user and group 1000, not root, and reads `/dev/null` as
  its standard input. A command that needs root, such as `mount`, reading
  `/dev/vda`, or writing under `/proc/sys`, fails with a permission error. It
  can still create files in `/tmp`.
- The file is `/tmp/.hermit-command-output` in the guest's memory. A command
  that reads or writes it interferes with its own output.
- A last line without a newline is printed with one, and NUL bytes and 0x01
  bytes are not preserved. Output that a background job writes after the
  command has exited is not shown.
- A kernel message printed in the middle of the END line hides that line, so
  the controller keeps waiting until a bound stops the run, which then fails
  (see "A run that does not finish" below); it never ends with a cut-off
  output.
- A boot snapshot saved before this change still runs an old `/init`, which
  prints a bare `__HERMIT_COMMAND_BEGIN__` line or one ending in `format=2`.
  The controller stops as soon as it sees such a line, names it, and the demo
  says to run `demos/clean.sh` and then demo 5 again. `demos/lib/qemu-assets.sh`
  rebuilds the initramfs by itself (its `.initramfs-version` is now 9), but
  only demo 5 saves a new boot snapshot.
- A reference run saved before this change was started with another kernel
  command line, without `printk.time=1`, so its comparison reports
  `WARN: QEMU argv differs from first run` and the run ends `PARTIAL`, never
  `SUCCESS`. This holds for demo 5's saved first boot too. `demos/clean.sh`
  removes both.

The resume runs under `hermit run --strict --epoch 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z
--no-rcb-time --target-timeslice 100000 --max-timeslice disabled`. It switches
QEMU's threads only at system calls and advances virtual time without counting
branches, so it needs no hardware performance counters. As in demo 5,
`--epoch` fixes the date the virtual clocks start from, `--base-env=minimal`
(plus `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE`) replaces your shell's environment, and the
guest reads `/dev/null` and writes to a pipe that the demo copies into the
Hermit log, so neither the host clock, your environment, nor the log file's
growing size reaches the guest. The controller runs from
`/tmp/hermit-demo-controller`, a copy of its source files made for each run,
and the assets directory (snapshot, command disk, serial transcript) is bound
at `/tmp/hermit-demo-assets`, so the checkout's location does not reach the
guest's command lines either. Before these paths were fixed, a fresh clone in
another directory resumed to a different post-command snapshot after 288657
scheduler turns instead of 287149.

A run that does not finish. The guest-side controller has no deadline of its
own, because time inside Hermit is virtual. Two bounds outside Hermit stop a
resume that does not end by itself (a command that never exits, or an END
line that a kernel message hid), and whichever is reached first wins:

- `QEMU_MAX_LOG_BYTES`, the size of Hermit's INFO log. At the default log
  filter Hermit wrote 18.5 to 19.2 MB of INFO log per second of resume on
  2026-10-03, so the 512 MiB cap stops the run after about 29 seconds. With
  the defaults this is the bound that stops a command that runs longer than
  that: a `sleep 1000000` failed after 31.1 seconds in one run and 30.9
  seconds in another.
- `QEMU_TIMEOUT`, the wall-clock seconds of the resume (120 by default). With
  the default cap it is reached only by a resume that logs more slowly.

Either way the demo prints a FAILURE line that names the bound, the size or
time it reached, and how far the guest had got, read from the serial log: no
BEGIN line yet, a BEGIN line with no END line (the command had not finished),
or an END line while Hermit and QEMU had not exited. Neither ends in
`SUCCESS`, and the run exits 1. For example, the command
`printf '__HERMIT_COMMAND_END__\001status=0\n' >&0; echo __HERMIT_COMMAND_END__ status=0; sleep 1000000`
ended on 2026-10-03, 30.9 seconds after the demo started, with (path shortened):

```text
WARN: Demo 6: QEMU Snapshot Resume: FAILURE: Hermit's INFO log .../run-history/resume-20261003T171535.068191Z-2392757/hermit-info.log grew to 538851401 bytes, past the 536870912-byte cap (QEMU_MAX_LOG_BYTES), 29.2s into the resume, so the run was stopped before QEMU_TIMEOUT (120s); the guest command had not finished: the serial log has the __HERMIT_COMMAND_BEGIN__ format=3 line but no END line
```

At either bound the demo stops Hermit and every process still in Hermit's
process group before it reports: the group is sent SIGTERM and then SIGKILL,
at most 10 seconds apart. On 2026-10-03, with `QEMU_TIMEOUT=20`, the command
`sleep 1000000` ended 22.0 seconds after the demo started, and no Hermit, QEMU,
or `sleep` process was left running.

The cap also holds after Hermit exits. The demo then waits up to 60 seconds
for the rest of Hermit's output to reach the INFO log. If a process Hermit
left running writes the log past the cap, or still holds Hermit's output open
after those 60 seconds, the demo stops it the same way and fails, with a cap
message that names Hermit's exit status or with
`Hermit's output was still open 60s after it exited, so the processes still holding it were stopped`.

Controls (environment variables):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `QEMU_RESUME_REPEAT` | `1` | Set to `0` to skip the second resume of a new command, which then compares nothing. `demos/run-all.sh` always sets it to `1`. |
| `QEMU_TIMEOUT` | `120` | Seconds before the resume is stopped, unless `QEMU_MAX_LOG_BYTES` stopped it first. With the default cap, a resume that keeps running is stopped by the cap after about 29 seconds, before this timeout; see "A run that does not finish". |
| `QEMU_ASSETS` | `ignored/qemu-linux` | Where demo 5's snapshot and this demo's results are kept. |
| `QEMU_BOOT_SNAPSHOT_DISK` | `$QEMU_ASSETS/hermit-boot.qcow2` | The boot snapshot to restore. |
| `QEMU_BIN` | `qemu-system-x86_64` on `PATH` | The QEMU binary. It must be the one demo 5 used. |
| `QEMU_MAX_LOG_BYTES` | 512 MiB | Stop the run if Hermit's event log grows past this size. Healthy resumes on 2026-09-30 wrote 169,751,813 bytes (`uname -a` with `--no-save-snapshot`, 10.0 to 11.4 seconds) and 258,227,125 to 259,021,561 bytes (the three commands above, saving a snapshot, 15.7 to 16.5 seconds) (Hermit 0.2.0 gdc92644f96f4, QEMU 10.1.2); Hermit 0.2.0 g770b95c505fa wrote 80 to 153 MB. A resume that keeps running reaches this cap after about 29 seconds (18.5 to 19.2 MB per second on 2026-10-03), so with the defaults it, not `QEMU_TIMEOUT`, is what stops a command that does not finish. The cap also holds while the demo waits, for up to 60 seconds after Hermit exits, for the rest of Hermit's output. |
