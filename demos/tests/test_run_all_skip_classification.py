"""Tests for how run-all.sh classifies a demo that declined to run.

A demo exits 0 when it cannot run -- demo 8 does this when its ASAN assets are
absent -- so the exit code alone cannot separate a pass from a skip. run-all.sh
reads the demo's SKIPPED line instead, records the demo as SKIP, and never
reports a skipped demo as passed. A sweep with a skip and no failure exits 3, so
a caller that reads only the exit status does not take it for a success. There
is no option that accepts a skip: a caller that accepts one checks for exit
status 3 itself.

Because the SKIPPED line is read from the demo's log, a log directory, log, or
summary that cannot be created, written, or read makes the sweep exit 4. An
unread log must never let a skip count as a pass.

Demos 5 and 6 also exit 0 after a run that only saved itself as their
reference run and compared nothing; their last result line then says FIRST RUN
SAVED. The sweep records such a demo as UNCOMPARED, exits 3 as for a skip, and
never reports it as passed. It also sets QEMU_BOOT_REPEAT=1 and
QEMU_RESUME_REPEAT=1, so that a demo with no reference run runs a second time
and compares.

Exit 0 alone is not a pass either: a demo passes only when its own last result
line, `=== Demo N: <title>: SUCCESS ===` with N its own number, says SUCCESS. A
demo that exits 0 without that line is recorded as FAIL.
