"""Demos 5 and 6 stop what Hermit leaves running and keep the log cap after it exits.

Demos 5 and 6 start Hermit, which runs QEMU, as the leader of a process group
of its own. A thread copies Hermit's standard output and error from a pipe into
the run's INFO log, and the demo waits for Hermit with two bounds: QEMU_TIMEOUT,
in wall-clock seconds, and QEMU_MAX_LOG_BYTES, the size of the INFO log. After
Hermit exits, the demo waits up to OUTPUT_DRAIN_TIMEOUT seconds for the rest of
the output to reach the log, because a process Hermit started inherits the pipe
and can hold it open.

Before this was fixed, reaching QEMU_TIMEOUT raised an error without stopping
Hermit, and the wait after Hermit exited checked neither the cap nor the
processes left in Hermit's group. A run past QEMU_TIMEOUT kept writing its log
for up to OUTPUT_DRAIN_TIMEOUT more seconds (one demo 6 run reached the 1 GiB
output limit of the wrapper it ran under), and a process that Hermit left
running could write the log past the cap.

These tests run each demo's own launch, copy and wait code with Hermit replaced
by a script that starts one process and then exits, leaving that process to
keep writing to the output it inherited, to hold the output open silently, or
to write a little and exit; or that never exits itself. The demo stops at its
first step after the wait, so no Hermit, QEMU or kernel is needed.

Two more checks use the same stand-in. The repeat check compares the log these
demos capture, so they start Hermit without HERMIT_LOG and HERMIT_LOG_FILE,
which would change which records the log holds or send them to a file instead;
the stand-in records the environment it was given. And demo 5 replaces its
private run directory in the saved log with a fixed token, which must leave
every other byte of the log as Hermit wrote it, a carriage return or a byte
that is not UTF-8 included; the stand-in writes such bytes.

Run directly (``python3 demos/tests/test_qemu_output_drain.py``) or via
``make -C demos test``.

# Stands in for Hermit. FAKE_HERMIT_MODE picks the one process it starts. It
# copies FAKE_HERMIT_TRANSCRIPT, when set, to FAKE_HERMIT_SERIAL_LOG, as QEMU
# would have written the serial log, and records its own PID and the started
# process's in FAKE_HERMIT_PIDS. Then it exits 0, except in mode "hung", where
# it writes 1 KiB to its output about every 10 milliseconds and never exits.
#
# Two modes do one more thing first. "record-environment" writes the values of
# HERMIT_LOG, HERMIT_LOG_FILE and RUST_LOG it was started with, as JSON, to
# FAKE_HERMIT_ENVIRONMENT. "write-output" writes the bytes of
# FAKE_HERMIT_OUTPUT to its output, with each @RUN_DIR@ replaced by the host
# directory that the demo binds at FAKE_HERMIT_BIND_TARGET in the guest.
#
# The two processes that write start only once the fake Hermit has exited (their
# parent PID changes when it does) and the demo's wait for it has returned (the
# test then creates the file FAKE_HERMIT_WAIT_ENDED), so everything they write
# arrives after the demo's wait for Hermit has ended, however slowly a busy
# machine runs the fake Hermit or the demo. That wait checks the log once more
# after Hermit exits, so output written before it returned could be found
# past the cap there instead of in the drain these tests are about.
