"""Tests for demo 8's result checks and for its seed calibration.

Both scripts decide PASS or FAIL from what `hermit run --chaos` returns: the
exit status (134 is the ASAN abort, 124 the timeout, 125 a wrapper failure,
122 Hermit's refusal after a late performance-counter interrupt), whether the
output holds a complete AddressSanitizer report, and whether two runs of one
seed print the same complete report. Each test puts a stub `hermit` first on
PATH that returns one scripted outcome, runs the real script, and checks that
the script accepts or refuses it for the stated reason. No real Hermit and no
btrfs-convert build are involved.

CalibrationControlsTest also builds a tiny C program with a real heap
use-after-free under AddressSanitizer, so the "a crash was found" path is fed
a genuine ASAN abort rather than hand-written text. It fails, rather than
skips, when the host cannot build it: without that program the tests could not
show that calibration ever accepts a seed. The stub runs that program on a
seed's first crash and prints the same output again on the seed's replay, as
two Hermit runs of one seed do; run natively, the program prints a different
PID and different addresses every time. CalibrationReportComparisonTest needs
no compiler: its planted program prints a saved report.

Hermit gives the program it runs a private /tmp. TmpBindTest and
CalibrationTmpBindTest check that both scripts bind the converter's directory
and its image into it when their paths begin with /tmp/, refuse a path under
/tmp that they cannot bind, and add nothing for paths outside /tmp. The stubs
record each run's arguments, and the tests compare them exactly.
