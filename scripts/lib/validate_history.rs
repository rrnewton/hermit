//! Two readers of the validate-run ledger: the TREE-KEYED result cache
//! (`cache_lookup_record`, validate.sh:620) and the runtime ESTIMATE
//! (`history_estimate`, validate.sh:936).
//!
//! # The cache predicate must match the PRODUCER and its evidence
//!
//! Both producers require `executed_tests > 0`: a missing count and a measured
//! zero are distinct facts, but neither proves that a test-bearing run completed.
//! The Rust driver carries that count from typed step outcomes, independently of
//! human-facing log verbosity. It also writes `executed_nodes`, because a
//! ~47-NODE DAG run must never be readable as a 47-TEST pass (see `write_ledger`
//! in `validate.rs`).
//!
//! So the predicate is dispatched on the row's own `producer` field: a
//! `validate.rs` row must carry `executed_tests > 0`, `executed_nodes > 0`,
//! **and** a satisfied coverage record; a bash row must carry
//! `executed_tests > 0`. That is one verifier per authority rather than one
//! generic field test, and a Rust row cannot substitute its node count for test
//! evidence.
//!
//! # Fail-open, never fail-hit
//!
//! Every unreadable/absent/ambiguous condition yields "no hit" and a real run.
//! A missing ledger, a malformed line, an unknown producer, an absent coverage
//! block — none of them can manufacture a reuse.
