# The pre-push hook's bare-URL step, with no cargo or rust-script run: both
# checkers are stubbed so only the hook's own handling of the bare-URL
# checker's exit status is under test. The checker itself is tested by its own
# unit tests (check.script_unit_tests) and by `make lint-checks`.
#
# Why the hook runs it at all: validation node doc.rustdoc denies rustdoc's
# bare_urls lint, but soft-green landing validates only after the push, so a
# bare URL reached `main` repeatedly (6166181d8f is one). The hook runs before
# the push, but only in a checkout that ran scripts/setup-hooks.sh; a merge
# made on GitHub runs no hook.
#
# ⚠️ FOUR OUTCOMES, NOT TWO. Findings must refuse and name the remedy; a checker
# that could not run must refuse WITHOUT claiming findings, including when it
# failed to compile, which rust-script reports as exit 1 just like findings; a
# missing checker is a stated skip, never a silent pass; and a branch deletion
# must not run it.
