# Run the unit tests carried by rust-script entrypoints.
#
# rust-scripts are not Cargo workspace members, so `cargo test` never sees them.
# `build.rust_scripts` compiles all tracked entrypoints and their test harnesses
# before this graph consumer runs. This script executes those harnesses; outside
# the graph, rust-script retains its ordinary compile-and-run behavior. Measured
# 2026-08-25 at hermit main a5fef7ff7623: seven entrypoints carried 84 unit tests
# between them and no target anywhere passed `--test`, so all 84 were documentation.
# They all passed once run, so this gate starts green.
#
# The file list is DISCOVERED, not hard-coded: a new script that grows a test
# module is picked up with no edit here. A hard-coded list would reproduce exactly
# the "someone has to remember" failure this gate was added to close.
#
# The harnesses are independent processes, so up to HERMIT_SCRIPT_TEST_JOBS of
# them run at once (the CI node check.script_unit_tests sets it to its admitted
# width; otherwise every online CPU). Each harness's stdout and stderr are
# buffered separately and printed whole, to the same streams, as soon as that
# harness finishes, so a node stopped by its wall bound still shows every
# harness that completed. Measured serially at d44bbbb79acd, unthrottled: 362 s,
# of which ci/compat-envelope/scorecard.rs took 162 s and scripts/validate.rs
# 131 s.
