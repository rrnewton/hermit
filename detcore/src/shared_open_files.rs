//! The canonical models of open file descriptions that several guest
//! processes share, and the leases through which a process reaches them.
//!
//! A backend that runs Detcore inside each guest process cannot share one
//! `Arc` between processes, so a description that a fork shares lives here,
//! in the global state, and each process's handle is `Shared` (see
//! `crate::fd::OpenFileState`). A `DetFd` method on a shared handle takes the
//! model, runs its synchronous body on it, and publishes it back, inside one
//! method call.
//!
//! - Only the thread that holds the scheduler's serial grant may take, so
//!   access is exclusive and happens in canonical order.
//! - The global state keeps the canonical model while a lease is out and sends
//!   a copy. A publish replaces the model only when it names the current lease,
//!   so a late, duplicate or foreign publish is refused. If the holder's
//!   process dies mid-lease, the lease ends and its unpublished change is
//!   discarded.
//! - Models move in chunks of at most [`CHUNK_LEN`] bytes, because a transport
//!   frame is bounded and a model (a directory or procfs snapshot) is not.
//!
//! Every message here is control traffic: it changes no clock, request slot,
//! scheduler membership or turn.
