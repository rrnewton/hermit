//! Keys for numbering the procfs entries that the host renumbers.
//!
//! Linux numbers most procfs inodes when it builds their dentries: every
//! per-process entry (`/proc/<pid>`, `/proc/<pid>/fd/<n>`, ...) and every
//! `/proc/sys` entry takes the next value of one host-wide counter
//! (`get_next_ino`). An unused dentry can be evicted at any time by memory
//! pressure on the host, or dropped by a failed lookup, and the next lookup
//! or `readdir` builds it again under a new number. The inode pool numbers a
//! host `(device, inode)` it has not seen as a new file, so the guest saw a
//! number that depended on whether the host had rebuilt the entry since the
//! guest last saw it: a second `lsof` listing of `/proc/3/fd` after the host
//! rebuilt its entries got new numbers in one `--verify` run and the old ones
//! in the other.
//!
//! So a procfs sighting also names the entry ([`ProcfsName`]): the key of its
//! path within procfs ([`path_inode`]), which does not depend on where procfs
//! is mounted, and the task IDs that path names. The pool numbers an entry by
//! its host inode first: a host inode it already knows keeps its number, so
//! aliases (one entry listed in `/proc/<pid>/net` and reached as
//! `/proc/<pid>/task/<pid>/net/tcp`) share it. Only a host inode the pool has
//! never seen, reached by a path it has seen, is that path's entry rebuilt,
//! and takes the path's number. A path key only ever leads to a host key; it
//! numbers nothing itself. A task ID that a new thread reuses names a new
//! task, whose entries are new files ([`with_incarnation`]), and an entry a
//! directory snapshot lists names the tasks that held its IDs when the
//! snapshot was taken ([`ProcfsName::in_snapshot`]).
//!
//! Detcore names an entry only once the guest's mount table says its device
//! is a procfs mount ([`procfs_mounts`]), and reads its canonical path from a
//! magic link in the guest thread's `/proc/<tid>` ([`inspect_link`]): the
//! link of the descriptor or working directory the call described, or, for a
//! call that named a path, the link of an `O_PATH` descriptor that Detcore
//! opens with the guest's own path, directory and root, and closes again
//! ([`read_open`], [`read_close`]). The mount the object was reached through,
//! which `statx` names, gives the mount point to take off that path and the
//! directory of procfs it shows, once that mount point, resolved without
//! following a link, leads to the root of the same mount ([`path_within`],
//! [`mount_root`]). When it cannot name a procfs entry (the mount table cannot
//! be read, the guest has no descriptor left or no longer holds the path it
//! named, the call named a path while the guest's threads are not
//! sequentialized, an injected call had no effect in every attempt, the
//! object found is not the one the guest saw, or was reached through a mount
//! the table does not list at a mount point that holds it) it numbers
//! the entry by its host inode and records a determinism loss, so the run is
//! not compared.
//!
//! Each of these numbers the entry as Detcore did before:
//!
//! - An entry rebuilt before Detcore first saw its path gets a new number,
//!   which that path then leads to.
//! - A path lookup crosses every mount on the guest's path again, and the
//!   check of a mount point every mount above it, so a mount on a FUSE file
//!   system whose server is a guest Detcore holds could stall it.
//! - `get_next_ino` wraps at 2^32, so a directory other than a procfs root can
//!   have inode 1, and has its link count reported as 1.
//! - Under a backend whose guest thread IDs do not name host tasks, there is
//!   no `/proc/<tid>` to read, and procfs entries keep their host keys: KVM's
//!   guest threads are not host tasks, and DBT's thread IDs are its
//!   scheduler's virtual IDs, in no PID namespace that gives its host tasks
//!   those IDs.
