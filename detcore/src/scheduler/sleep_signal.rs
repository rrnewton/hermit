//! Cross-task signals that end an emulated `pause` or `nanosleep`
//! (<https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3982>).
//!
//! Detcore never runs either call in the kernel. It parks the thread in the
//! scheduler's timed waiters on `SleepUntil(deadline)`, `INDEFINITE` for a
//! `pause`, and the thread stays in its ptrace stop there. A signal another
//! guest thread sends it is queued in the kernel and stays pending, because the
//! thread does not run, and nothing in the scheduler woke it: a child parked in
//! `pause()` that its parent killed with `SIGTERM` slept forever while the
//! parent sat in `wait4`.
//!
//! Only on a backend whose kernel reports the guest's signal state
//! (`models_signal_targets`), as for a precise-mode futex wait:
//!
//! - The sender's turn records the signal (`notify_signal_pending`) when the
//!   target's filed request is one of these sleeps
//!   ([`Scheduler::admits_sleep_signal`]). Not recorded: a `SIGKILL`, which the
//!   kernel acts on for a traced thread without the thread running, as before;
//!   a signal the target's waits hold (`futex_wait_held_signals`: `SIGCHLD` and
//!   host-timed signals), as for a precise futex wait, because the kernel can
//!   also post it at a host-chosen moment, so neither its pending bit nor a
//!   recorded send can say whether a later guest call took it back; and a
//!   signal Linux discards at generation because it is unblocked and ignored
//!   (`KernelSignalState::discarded_at_generation`), read in the sender's turn,
//!   before any later disposition change. Under ptrace the
//!   kernel queues that discarded signal anyway, for the tracer, and delivers
//!   it if a handler is installed before the thread resumes: a ptrace artifact
//!   this module does not change.
//! - The step2 drain, where no guest thread holds the turn, decides whether the
//!   signal still interrupts the sleep ([`Scheduler::sleep_interrupting_signals`]):
//!   it must still be pending for the target, so a stop signal a `SIGCONT`
//!   cancelled, or one that `sigaction(SIG_IGN)` flushed, does not count; and
//!   unblocked by the mask the target stopped with, and caught or acted on by
//!   default under the dispositions the kernel holds now. A disposition changes
//!   only in some thread's turn, and a recorded signal's pending bit only by a
//!   guest's own call, since held signals are never recorded.
//! - An interrupting signal replaces the request with the one-resource signal
//!   set (`WaitidSignals`) and queues the thread at the front of its band, so it
//!   is the next thread to resume and dequeue the signal. Its turn answers
//!   `Signaled`.
//! - A state that cannot be read leaves the sleep parked: when the thread is
//!   gone, its retirement removes it; otherwise the run ends with a diagnostic
//!   rather than a guest interruption invented from a failed read.
//!
//! Membership in the drain is fixed by the sender's committed turn, and the
//! decision reads only scheduler-ordered state, so where the wake falls in the
//! schedule does not depend on host timing.
//!
//! The woken thread decides again in its own turn (`syscalls::signal::sleep_signal`),
//! and also checks before it parks, so a signal sent while it was stopped short
//! of filing its request is not lost. `pause` returns `ERESTARTNOHAND` for a
//! woken signal still pending for it, so the kernel runs a handler and returns
//! `EINTR`, kills the process, or stops it and restarts the call; `EINTR` for a
//! held one the scheduler sent (a child-exit `SIGCHLD`); and with none it waits
//! again (`Detcore::handle_pause`). A
//! `nanosleep` returns `EINTR` with the remaining time, or sleeps again until
//! its original deadline. Its restart after a stop would have to keep the deadline, which
//! Detcore does not model for it, so a stop signal does not end a `nanosleep`;
//! the stop takes effect when the sleep ends, as before. Nor does a signal that
//! arrives once the deadline has passed: the sleep completes normally and the
//! signal is delivered as the call returns.
