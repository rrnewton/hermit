//! The scheduler's SIGALRM ledger, for guest SIGALRM handlers on a backend
//! that runs Detcore inside each guest process (in-guest LiteInst).
//!
//! Design: dev-hermit `ai_docs/transient/liteinst-inguest-signal-handlers-design-20261007.md`,
//! phase 1, step I1a, under <https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3520>.
//!
//! - A process's runtime publishes whether its SIGALRM disposition is a guest
//!   handler. While it is, an emulated `alarm`/`setitimer` expiry adds a ledger
//!   entry instead of sending a physical signal. A second expiry while one is
//!   pending is absorbed: standard-signal coalescing in the process's one
//!   shared queue.
//! - The runtime also publishes each thread's "SIGALRM virtually blocked" bit,
//!   inside the turn of the call that changes its mask. No expiry commits
//!   while a thread holds its turn, so the bit is current at every expiry and
//!   every admission. An entry is *due* when that bit is clear. (Publishing it
//!   by control message rather than on every request leaves the request wire,
//!   `Resources`, unchanged.)
//! - A due entry ends an emulated `pause`: at the pause's own admission, when
//!   the entry is already due as it is selected, or at the expiry, when the
//!   pause is already parked. Either way the pause returns EINTR.
//! - A due entry whose owner is blocked in any other wait records a
//!   determinism loss: Linux would interrupt that wait, and phase 1 cannot.
//!   That includes a polling wait (`InternalIOPolling` retried after EAGAIN),
//!   whose thread stays on the run queue between retries. A running thread, or
//!   one whose filed request has not blocked, takes the entry at its syscall's
//!   completion; that delivery is the runtime's (later steps).
//! - Every change happens at a scheduler commit: an expiry, an admission, or
//!   the sweep that opens step 2. So what is pending, and what is due, is a
//!   function of the schedule.
//!
//! Nothing publishes a handled SIGALRM until the runtime admits guest
//! handlers, so this module changes no run today.
