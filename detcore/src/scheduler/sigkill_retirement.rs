//! Retiring a SIGKILLed process at the kill turn on ptrace
//! (<https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3994>).
//!
//! On a backend whose only report of a thread's death is its own
//! deregistration, a process killed by another guest process used to leave the
//! scheduler whenever that report arrived, at a moment the host chose. Here the
//! scheduler's view changes at one committed point instead, the sending turn:
//!
//! 1. **Reserved.** Before the physical send, the sender reserves the victims:
//!    every live thread of the target process except its own, with the
//!    address-space identity each registered with (`Scheduler::thread_mm`).
//!    A victim's consuming receipt (its deregistration) that arrives now is
//!    accounted but held: it retires nothing ([`Scheduler::route_sigkill_receipt`]).
//! 2. **Committed.** After a successful send, the scheduler retires each victim
//!    in tid order (`logically_kill_thread`). A victim with a filed request is
//!    never answered or granted again: the kernel ends the tracee, and the
//!    backend's exit path ends its task without the tool injecting anything. A
//!    failed send unwinds the reservation: a held receipt then takes the
//!    ordinary path, as if no kill had been prepared.
//! 3. **Physical exit accounted.** Each committed victim's first consuming
//!    receipt is accounted as usual; one held since state 1 already was.
//! 4. **Fence released.** Turn selection waits until every committed victim is
//!    in state 3 ([`Scheduler::sigkill_fence_holds`]), so the physical death is
//!    settled before the next guest instruction; host timing decides only how
//!    long the pause lasts.
