//! One `SIGCHLD` per child exit, with Linux's siginfo, on a backend that
//! reports child-exit publication (ptrace), where the kernel sends the parent
//! its own `SIGCHLD` besides the one the scheduler sends at the child's
//! `ChildExit` timer (<https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3895>).
//!
//! The scheduler's copy stays process-directed, as before: when the kernel's
//! copy is already pending in the process's shared queue, Linux coalesces
//! the two, and the parent gets one. What this adds:
//!
//! - The exit grant of a child whose notification the scheduler sends
//!   (classified Deliver or Undecided) records the child as *owned* by its
//!   parent, with the siginfo Linux gives the parent. The exiting thread
//!   tells the scheduler its exit status just before its `Exit` request
//!   ([`ChildExitSigchldControl::ExitStatus`]).
//! - The first `SIGCHLD` delivered for an owned child stands for its exit:
//!   the kernel's copy (`si_code` `CLD_EXITED`, `CLD_KILLED` or `CLD_DUMPED`
//!   from the child, [`ChildExitSigchldControl::ClaimKernelCopy`]) or the
//!   scheduler's (`SI_USER` from the tracer,
//!   [`ChildExitSigchldControl::TakeOwnCopy`]). A copy of either kind that
//!   arrives after it is dropped (Detcore's signal hook returns none, or its
//!   filter of unreported signals drops it). Before, the kernel's copy that
//!   arrived after the scheduler's was delivered as a second `SIGCHLD`.
//! - The scheduler's copy, when delivered, gets Linux's siginfo instead of
//!   the tracer's: `CLD_EXITED` and the exit code, the child's pid and real
//!   uid. `si_utime` and `si_stime` are 0 (natively, host CPU time). When the
//!   kernel's copy arrives before the timer, it is the one delivered, and the
//!   timer sends nothing.
//!
//! Which thread takes a process-directed `SIGCHLD`, and when a kernel copy
//! that arrives after the scheduler's interrupts that thread, still depend
//! on host timing, as before; a dropped copy only makes that interruption
//! deliver nothing.
