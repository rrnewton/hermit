/// the original call stopped at that word too. Success means the probe itself
/// just stored host seconds in those exact bytes; only then does Hermit replace
/// the word with its virtual value. Other probe errors and overwrite failures
/// fail closed because host time may remain.

/// An EFAULT from the probe is only evidence about `tv` if it came from the
/// store. A seccomp filter can return EFAULT for `time(2)` without running it,
/// and would otherwise end the repair while host time remains in a writable
/// `tv`. Two checks therefore confirm every EFAULT before it is trusted.
/// First, `time(NULL)` is injected: it stores nothing and cannot fail on
/// Linux, so any error means the probes are not reaching the native call.
/// Second, every word from the stopped one onward must still read exactly as
/// it did before the original call: readable with the same value, or
/// unreadable both times and not fully mapped, so that the store could only
/// have faulted. A changed word was stored by that call, and an unreadable
/// word that is fully mapped may have been, because a failed read is not
/// itself a fault. Each of these failures ends the run, including for the
/// mapped but unreadable pages listed at `require_unmapped_unreadable_word`.
///
/// These checks are observations Detcore makes with its own syscalls, so they
/// trust those syscalls' results, as every Detcore handler that reads back a
/// result does. They catch a filter that makes a syscall fail, whether it is
/// the guest's probe or Detcore's own read. A seccomp filter installed on
/// Hermit itself can also make one of Detcore's own syscalls report success
/// without running it, and that is outside this guarantee. A guest cannot
/// install a filter: Detcore refuses `seccomp(2)` and `PR_SET_SECCOMP`.
///
/// The repair never writes a word the kernel could not store, and it does not
/// test writability by rewriting a word, because a remote write ignores
/// protection keys that deny the guest's own stores. The pre-call snapshot is
/// a read only. The host seconds written by a successful
/// probe exist transiently until the overwrite. Default thread
/// sequentialization prevents another guest thread from observing that
/// interval, but another process sharing the page can observe it; such
/// external shared state is outside Hermit's determinism guarantee.
/// Standard record/replay disables time virtualization, so this handler is not
/// used there. A custom configuration that combines replay data with virtual
/// time fails closed before probing: a recorded EFAULT does not establish that
/// this execution performed any stores for a live `time(2)` to reproduce.
///
/// Every backend runs this repair. The memory map comes from
/// `Guest::storable_memory_ranges`, which lists `/proc/<pid>/maps` of the
/// guest by default and the guest's own page record on a backend whose
/// `pid()` is not the guest (KVM). A backend that executes `gettimeofday` and
