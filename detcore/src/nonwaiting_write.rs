//! Diagnostic writes that never wait for the reader of a descriptor.
//!
//! While `--max-log-bytes` is in force, termination of a run must not depend
//! on any diagnostic write (review of
//! <https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/pull/3686>). A plain `write(2)` to a
//! blocking stderr whose reader stopped reading waits forever, so every
//! hermit diagnostic that can run in a capped run before the cap or the 123
//! classification goes through [`write_without_waiting`] once
//! [`forbid_waiting_diagnostics`] has been called.
//!
//! [`crate::util::RetryingStderr`] reads the same flag: while it is set, its
//! writes go through [`write_without_waiting_for_a_reader`] and wait only
//! within its bounded deadline, never inside `write(2)`.
//!
//! This lives in detcore, below the `hermit` library and binary, because
//! detcore's own stderr writer reads the flag, and because `hermit`'s
//! `proc_mount` writes its warning from the namespace-only `pre_exec` callback,
//! after `fork`, and from the container init: every function here except
//! [`write_without_waiting_for_a_reader`] makes only syscalls and signal-set
//! operations, without allocation, stdio locks or formatting.
