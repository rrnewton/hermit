//! Regression coverage for <https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3328>.
//!
//! After every successful `openat`, Detcore injects an `fstat` to record the
//! new descriptor's metadata. The ptrace backend used to stage that `fstat`
//! buffer in the guest's stack below `rsp` and turned a failed staging write
//! into the result of the guest's `openat`. A guest whose stack pointer sits
//! close to the end of its writable stack then saw a successful open reported
//! as `EFAULT`, while the real descriptor stayed open. That stopped the glibc
//! dynamic loader of three real test binaries before `main`.
//!
//! The guest here issues one raw `openat` with its stack pointer a chosen
//! number of bytes above memory it cannot write, and requires the result
//! Linux gives natively: the lowest free descriptor, usable, and not leaked.
