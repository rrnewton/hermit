//! In-guest Detcore runtime for the LiteInst backend.
//!
//! Hermit preloads this library into the guest for `--backend=liteinst`. When
//! the dynamic loader loads it, its constructor installs Detcore's `Tool`
//! inside the guest process before the program's `main`. The loader, the C library's initialization, `IFUNC`
//! resolvers and the constructors of the program's own shared libraries run
//! earlier, unmonitored. A loader that fails to load the library runs the
//! guest without it; Hermit reports that the guest never connected only after
//! the guest exits. Once Detcore is installed, patched system calls and the
//! SIGSYS fallback dispatch to Detcore in the guest, and Detcore's global
//! state stays in Hermit, reached over the coordinator RPC socket that
//! `reverie_liteinst::LiteinstBackend::run_with_preload` creates. No ptrace
//! tracer sits on the system-call path.
