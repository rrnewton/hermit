//! `--verify` must not claim determinism it did not check.
//!
//! Reverie types many syscall output buffers as bare pointers, so the compared
//! records show the buffer's ADDRESS and not its bytes. Two runs whose buffers
//! differ while their return values agree therefore produce character-identical
//! records and compare equal. Measured on a netlink `recvmsg` that returns a
//! stable `Ok(1468)` while four payload bytes vary: the same guest reported
//! `verdict: matched, bitwise_parity: true` and printed "Determinism verified",
//! while the same command with `--detlog-io-buffers` reported `diverged`.
//!
//! The coverage fix was to make that hashing the DEFAULT rather than an opt-in;
//! `--no-detlog-io-buffers` now selects the weaker comparison deliberately. This
//! test guards the other half: that when content was NOT compared, the verdict
//! says so instead of claiming determinism outright.
