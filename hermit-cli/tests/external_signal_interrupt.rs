//! Regression coverage for signals interrupting a blocked futex wait
//! (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3146).
//!
//! Linux interrupts a blocking `FUTEX_WAIT` when a signal with a handler is
//! delivered. An untimed wait restarts under `SA_RESTART`; a timed wait
//! returns `EINTR` even under `SA_RESTART`. Each case below runs the guest in
//! `tests/c/external_signal_interrupt.c` under the ptrace backend and asserts
//! the guest's single deterministic `RESULT` line.
//!
//! A signal that is ignored, blocked, or ignored by default must not end a
//! wait: `poll`, `epoll_wait`, `select`, and a timed futex wait then run to
//! their 300 ms deadline.
//!
//! Nor does a SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, or SIGTTOU left at its default action end a
//! `poll` with a timeout or a timed `FUTEX_WAIT`, because Detcore restarts those
//! two calls with their relative timeout re-armed. In an orphaned process group
//! Linux discards such a signal and restarts the call with its original
//! deadline, so these calls still return at 300 ms, and the other waits restart
//! with their deadline kept or, for `epoll_wait`, return EINTR.
//!
//! Signal dispositions belong to the whole process, so a sibling can change
//! one while a waiter is parked. The disposition that counts is the one in
//! force when the signal arrives, not the one when the wait began: a signal
//! caught after the wait parked ends it near the 100 ms send, and one ignored
//! after the wait parked leaves it running to its original deadline.
//!
//! A SIGCHLD never ends a gated wait (a futex wait, `poll` or `epoll_wait`),
//! whoever sends it: Hermit holds a caught SIGCHLD until the call returns, and
//! the handler runs then, as on Hermit's main branch. Linux instead returns
//! EINTR when the SIGCHLD arrives. This gives up the SIGCHLD part of
//! https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3146 until Reverie reports every
//! delivery it holds. The `held` cells assert it: a child's exit, including a
//! child that dies by SIGKILL or by its only thread calling `exit`, leaves the
//! wait running to its 300 ms deadline or its wakeup, and the handler has run
//! by the `RESULT` line. `select` and the `select` system call are not gated,
//! so a caught SIGCHLD still ends them with EINTR, as on Linux.
//!
//! A child's SIGCHLD is queued on its parent process and taken by one thread
//! that does not block it; Linux offers it first to the thread that forked the
//! child. The role cells give the waiter a sibling that does not block SIGCHLD
//! and check both the waiter's result and which thread's handler ran. A
//! runnable sibling that forks the child takes the signal, and the waiter keeps
//! waiting to its original deadline or its wakeup. A sibling that forks the
//! child and then parks in a wait of its own holds it until that wait returns.
//! A waiting main thread that forks the child while a sibling spins does not
//! take it: the sibling does, and the sibling's wake ends the wait, or, for a
//! timed wait the sibling does not wake, the wait runs to its deadline.
//!
//! Every cell with only Hermit-internal senders runs under strict verification
//! (`--verify --verify-strict`) and requires a matched strict report.
//!
//! The watchdog lives in this host process, as in
//! `waitid_signal_interrupt.rs`: a dedicated thread drains Hermit's stderr
//! while this thread polls the process, the guest's stdout file, and an
//! independent wall-clock deadline. A lost interruption is a hang, so each
//! run must print `RESULT` within `RESULT_BOUND` of `READY`.
//!
//! External cells send `SIGUSR1` from this host process, which is outside
//! Hermit's deterministic schedule; the `usr2` cells add `SIGUSR2`, and the
//! external-SIGCHLD cells send a caught `SIGCHLD` instead, to a guest that never
//! had a child, reaped one, or has a live one. Linux ends `select` with EINTR
//! for it in all three. Every such trial runs the guest through a symlink in a
//! fresh directory, so the guest is found by its exact `argv[0]`.
//!
//! Not covered here:
//! - An external signal to a precise-mode futex waiter: with no in-guest waker
//!   Hermit's deadlock detector ends the run before the signal can arrive.
//! - External signals to blocked `wait4`/`waitid`. Those still do not observe
//!   a host-queued signal; that is a separate defect in the same issue.
//! - A caught SIGCHLD sent from outside Hermit to a gated wait. It is held until
//!   the call returns, like every SIGCHLD (above), where Linux returns EINTR at
//!   once; Hermit main did not end `poll` or `epoll_wait` for it either. Only
//!   the select waits, which are not gated, are asserted above.
//! - The `spin` role in polling mode. Between probes a polling waiter blocks
//!   every signal, so the running sibling takes the SIGCHLD that Linux gives the
//!   waiting thread that forked the child.
//! - LiteInst. LiteInst now runs only in-guest, and the in-guest run refuses
//!   `--verify` and a guest signal handler other than `SIG_DFL` or `SIG_IGN`
//!   (https://github.com/rrnewton/reverie/issues/243). Every cell here needs one
//!   or the other: each cell with only Hermit-internal senders runs under
//!   `--verify`, and each external cell catches the signal it is sent. The
//!   LiteInst cells are restoration targets
//!   (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3745).
//! - A default SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, or SIGTTOU in a process group that is not
//!   orphaned. Linux stops the process when the signal arrives; Detcore lets a
//!   `poll` with a timeout or a timed `FUTEX_WAIT` run to its end first, and the
//!   process stops when the call returns, as on hermit main.
//! - The terminal's signals other than SIGHUP and SIGWINCH. Once the guest may
//!   have a terminal, Hermit holds every signal a terminal sends until a gated
//!   wait returns: SIGINT, SIGQUIT, and SIGTSTP for the interrupt, quit, and
//!   suspend characters, and SIGTTIN and SIGTTOU for a background read or
//!   write, as well as the SIGHUP and SIGWINCH cells assert. Only the Detcore
//!   unit tests assert those five. Typing an interrupt or quit character also
//!   signals Hermit, which is in the same foreground process group.

/// SIGUSR1 handler has run. `kill` returns once the signal is queued, so every
/// SIGCHLD has been sent before the wait starts and none arrives while it runs.
/// Standard signals merge, so at most one may still be pending in the kernel
/// then; if one is, the first `/proc` read shows it, and the stop it makes is
/// identified and held to the call's return (`HeldKind::Precious`). Nothing
/// here requires that a SIGCHLD is still pending, so this test covers the
/// deadline after a flood, not arrivals during the wait.
///
/// The flood used to follow the SIGUSR1, so it raced the wait's first probe and
/// its mask change, the two injections that run under the guest's own mask. A
/// SIGCHLD that arrives after Detcore's `/proc` read and before such an
/// injection stops it in a way `/proc` cannot identify, because the backend
/// does not say which signal it holds. A second SIGCHLD pending before the
/// next injection would replace that unidentified held signal, which may be
/// one whose loss matters, so since round 10 of
/// https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/pull/3361 the wait is refused there,
/// fail-closed, before the injection (`KernelSignalWait::inject_absorbing`,
/// `HeldSignalLoss::Replaced`), and the run ends with HERMIT_POLICY_REFUSAL.
/// Whether two flood signals land in that window is host timing, so the cell
/// was refused intermittently, most often on a loaded host, and a refused run
/// also made the harness's remaining `kill` calls fail with ESRCH. The Detcore
/// unit tests pin each decision of that path:
/// `a_stop_that_cannot_be_identified_keeps_a_timed_wait_and_its_deadline`, and
/// `a_sigchld_after_an_unidentified_stop_is_refused_before_it_replaces_it` for
