//! Observes guest processes' physical exits through pidfds, for backends whose
//! processes leave the host some time after their scheduler-granted exit.
//!
//! Detcore holds only abstract lifetime state; how a process's exit is observed
//! on the host belongs to the backend (owner directive 082). A backend hands
//! this watcher one pidfd per guest process (from `pidfd_open`, or a socket's
//! `SO_PEERPIDFD`) together with the process id Detcore knows it by. The
//! watcher calls the backend's callback with that id exactly once, after the
//! exit is complete as the guest's parent can see it; a backend wires the
//! callback to `GlobalState::complete_physical_process_exit`.
//!
//! The pidfd alone is not enough. `exit_notify` runs under
//! `write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock)`: it sets the zombie state, then
//! `do_notify_parent` wakes pidfd waiters and only then queues SIGCHLD to the
//! parent. So when the pidfd becomes readable, the watcher calls
//! `waitid(P_PIDFD, pidfd, WEXITED | WNOHANG | WNOWAIT)`. While the process is
//! unreaped, the kernel takes `read_lock(&tasklist_lock)` for that call
//! (`__do_wait`), which cannot be granted until `exit_notify`'s write section,
//! and with it the SIGCHLD queueing, has finished. A non-parent gets `ECHILD`
//! and nothing is consumed; `WNOWAIT` leaves a parent's zombie in place. If
//! the process was already reaped, `release_task` ran after that section
//! anyway. Either way, a parent probing its pending signals or children sees
//! the exit in every run once it is reported.
//!
//! The watcher never waits on or reaps a process: the guest's own parent, or
//! the backend's launcher for the root, stays the only reaper.
//!
//! [`PhysicalExitWatch::new`] watches on a thread of its own.
//! [`PhysicalExitWatch::on_runtime`] watches on an existing tokio runtime
//! instead, for a launcher that must not create a thread: in-guest LiteInst's
//! coordinator shares the guest's PID namespace, where every thread takes a
//! process id the guest would otherwise see.
