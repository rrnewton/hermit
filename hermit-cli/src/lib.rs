/// `record_or_replay_config` decided whether the recorder EMITS the hash, and
/// `record_start.rs`'s `ComparisonOptions` decided whether the comparator READS
/// it. Both were hard-coded `false`, neither was reachable from the command
/// line, and nothing related them. Setting either alone achieves nothing: hash
/// without compare is dead weight, compare without hash finds nothing. Naming

/// A GREEN RECORD/REPLAY VERDICT IS NOT A DETERMINISM RESULT.
///
/// Named for the same reason as [`RECORD_REPLAY_HASHES_IO_BUFFERS`] directly
/// above: the decision was about to be carried twice. `metadata.rs`'s
/// `record_or_replay_config` sets the config the recorder and replayer run
/// under, and `record_start.rs`'s `ComparisonOptions` now discloses that setting
/// in the verdict. If those two disagreed, the report would describe a time
/// policy the run did not use — which is precisely the class of defect the
/// disclosure exists to close, reintroduced one layer up.
///

/// gate and script on this project decides pass/fail from exactly that value.
/// The information was not missing, only discarded: reverie's container reports
/// the child's real status as a typed `ExitStatus`, and hermit collapsed it to
/// prose and then to `1`.
///
/// WHY THIS DOES NOT BREAK THE "hermit's exit IS the guest's exit" CONTRACT.
/// That contract describes the case where the guest RAN AND EXITED, and it is
/// untouched: a guest status still flows through `raise_or_exit` unchanged, and
/// only the `Err` arm — where there is NO guest exit code, because hermit failed
/// before or instead of producing one — uses this value. The contract did not
/// cover that case; it does now.
///
/// WHY 125. It is the established convention for "the wrapper tool itself
/// failed" — GNU `env`, `chroot` and `timeout` all reserve 125 for exactly this,
/// leaving 126/127 for exec-level problems. It is not a value hermit emits
/// anywhere else.
///
/// ⚠️ THIS REDUCES A COLLISION, IT DOES NOT REMOVE ONE. A guest is free to exit
/// 125 deliberately, and every value in 0..=255 is a legal guest status, so no
/// code can be reserved outright. What it removes is the GUARANTEED collision
/// with the most common failure code. For an unambiguous signal, read the
/// `HERMIT_TASK_PANIC` marker on stderr or the verification JSON; this makes the
/// cheap check — `$?` — stop actively lying.
///
/// ⚠️ IT LIVES IN THE LIBRARY, NOT IN `main.rs`, AND THAT PLACEMENT IS THE FIX
/// FOR HOW IT WENT STALE. It was a private `const` inside the binary, so
/// `tests/cli.rs` — the only thing that asserts on it — could not name it and
/// wrote the number out by hand instead. When hermit#2558 moved the value from
/// `1` to `125`, the definition moved and the sixteen copies did not: eight cli
/// tests went red on main and stayed red, each failing an assertion about the
/// exit code rather than about the behaviour it exists to check. Same shape as
/// [`RECORD_REPLAY_HASHES_IO_BUFFERS`] above — a decision carried in two places
/// that had to agree and had no way to. Exported here, the tests move with it.
///
/// ⚠️ DO NOT FLIP EVERY `Some(1)` YOU FIND. `tests/stress_suite.rs`
/// asserts `Some(1)` as THE GUEST'S OWN SIGNAL, not as a stale copy of this
/// constant: there `Some(1) => GuestOutcome::Exposed`, and
/// `status.code() == Some(1)` IS the `exposes_bug` predicate. It is
/// pattern-identical to the tests that DID go stale, and it is the OPPOSITE
/// case -- the assertion is CORRECT and must not move with this constant.
///
/// ⚠️ ITS FAILURE MODE IS SILENT SUCCESS. Changing it to 125 would not
/// turn the stress suite red; it would make `exposes_bug` NEVER FIRE, so the
/// suite would report no bug exposed forever and pass while blind. A red is
/// recoverable; a green that cannot fail is not.

// ⚠️ THE VALUES THEMSELVES ARE PINNED, NOT ONLY THEIR NAMES.
//
// Naming a constant makes every consumer agree with the definition; it does not
// make the definition right. Once `tests/cli.rs` asserts `Some(THE_CONSTANT)`
// everywhere, the whole suite is self-consistent and completely unanchored -- a
// one-character edit here would move all sixteen assertions with it and nothing
// would fail. That is the exact shape of the defect this scheme exists to close,
// displaced one level up, and it is why these are compile-time assertions rather
// than a comment: a deliberate edit "would be noticed" is the argument that
// already failed once, when hermit#2558 moved 1 -> 125 and sixteen copies went
// stale.
//
// WHY EACH VALUE AND NOT ANOTHER. GNU `env`, `chroot` and `timeout` reserve 125
// for "the wrapper itself failed", 127 for "command not found" and 126 for
// "found but not executable". Borrowing the whole scheme rather than one number
// is what keeps the three answers distinguishable from each other.
//
// ⚠️ THE EXIT-CODE ALLOCATION FOR THE `hermit` BINARY. ONE TABLE, HERE.
//
// Five separate exit-code defects were found in one evening and every one of
// them came from a value being chosen, copied or rewritten somewhere that could
// not see the others. This is the single place the space is allocated; anything
// that emits or rewrites a hermit exit status is a consumer OF this table and
// must not invent its own reading of it.
//
//   0          success.
//   1          HERMIT_VERIFICATION_DIVERGENCE_EXIT, matching `diff`; also a
//              legal guest status. Read the verification JSON to distinguish.
//   2 ..= 121  THE GUEST'S OWN STATUS, passed through untouched. (The range
//              stops at 121 because 122 is reserved below; a guest may still
//              CHOOSE any value, see the caveat at the end.)
//   122        HERMIT_POLICY_REFUSAL_EXIT -- hermit REFUSED the run under a
//              fail-closed policy. Hermit WORKED; the run was stopped on
//              purpose and the reason was printed. Distinct from 125 because
//              "hermit refused" and "hermit broke" demand opposite responses:
//              read the refusal and change your program or flags, versus file a
//              bug. Defined in `detcore-model` because `detcore` emits it and
//              this crate recognises it, and that is the only crate both
//              depend on.
//   123        HERMIT_LOG_CAP_EXIT -- a LOG BYTE CAP fired. Hermit's own
//              `--max-log-bytes` budget on its tracing output, and the value
//              reserved for dev-hermit's `bin/safehermit` log-cap kill (which,
//              as of 2026-09-26, still exits 125 -- see the 125 note below).
//              Hermit's spelling prints `HERMIT_LOG_CAP class=log-cap`.
//   124        DO NOT USE. GNU `timeout`'s deadline, and dev-hermit's
//              `bin/safehermit` WALL DEADLINE kill. `tests/cli.rs` asserts
//              `assert_ne!(code, Some(124))` on the awk-mincore probe.
//   125        HERMIT_INTERNAL_FAILURE_EXIT -- hermit itself failed, no guest
//              ran. NOT YET THE SOLE MEANING through dev-hermit's
//              `bin/safehermit`: that wrapper has exited 125 for its
//              log-byte-cap kill since it was created on 2026-08-20 and still
//              did on 2026-10-05, so a run through it produces one number for
//              two faults with opposite remedies (see "125 ⚠️ NOT FREE" below).
//              An earlier version of this table said safehermit had already
//              moved off 125; it never did. The intended fix is that SAFEHERMIT
//              MOVES -- to the 123 reserved for it above -- NOT HERMIT, because
//              that wrapper is the only layer that knows which happened (it
//              relays hermit's status otherwise) and because 125/126/127 is one
//              GNU scheme that cannot be broken up. Tracked as
//              `hermit_s_125_collides`.
//   126        GUEST_PROGRAM_NOT_EXECUTABLE_EXIT.
//   127        GUEST_PROGRAM_NOT_FOUND_EXIT -- the ABSOLUTE-PATH form. The
//              bare-name-on-guest-PATH form currently exits 125 instead, which
//              is an inconsistency tracked as `hermit_reports_a_missing`, not a
//              second meaning for 127.
//   128 + N    killed by signal N (shell convention). Hermit does not emit these
//              deliberately; a wrapper reporting a signal death must use them
//              rather than borrow a code that already means something.
//
// ⚠️ NO CODE IS EXCLUSIVELY HERMIT'S. Every value in 0..=255 is a legal guest
// status, so a guest may return 125 or 127 of its own accord and this table
// cannot stop it. The table removes GUARANTEED collisions, not possible ones.
// The only unambiguous discriminator is the `HERMIT_INTERNAL_FAILURE` marker on
// stderr, present exactly when hermit itself failed. Any consumer deciding on
// `$?` alone is guessing, and should say so.
//
// ⚠️ THE SAME ARGUMENT APPLIES TO 124, AND MORE SHARPLY, BECAUSE FIVE
// MECHANISMS PRODUCE IT. `hermit run --timeout`, its unwind fallback, `hermit
// record --record-timeout`, the `timeout(1)` wrapped around a manifest cell, and
// `safehermit`'s wall deadline all exit 124, and GNU `timeout` uses it for the
// same event. They demand different responses -- a slow guest, a wedged
// teardown inside hermit, a cell bound set too low, a run that escaped every
// inner bound -- so `$?` cannot route the reader to any of them.
//
// The discriminator is again the marker on stderr, and it is a CONTRACT rather
// than a diagnostic nicety: `class=run-timeout` for hermit's own bound (which
// also states the bound in seconds), `HERMIT_RUN_TIMEOUT_FALLBACK` for the
// unwind failing to complete, `safehermit: bound.wall=` for the cgroup reap.
// EXIT 124 WITH NO MARKER AT ALL MEANS NO INNER BOUND FIRED -- something outside
// hermit killed the run -- which is a configuration error and not a slow guest.
// The full picture, including which rung bounds which quantity and the
// strict-inequality invariant between them, is docs/TIMEOUT_LADDER.md.
//
// ⚠️ DO NOT CLAMP INTO THIS RANGE. `scripts/hermit-code-coverage.rs` used
// `clamp(1, 125)` and so rewrote 127 and 126 into 125 -- turning "your program is
// missing" into "hermit broke" and pointing the reader at the wrong project.
// Truncating a status does not lose information here, it MANUFACTURES a false
// attribution, because the ceiling is itself a meaning.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT EACH VALUE MUST NOT COLLIDE WITH -- AND 125 ALREADY DOES.
//
//   0    success. Never a failure code; see the nonzero pin below.
//   1    the commonest guest exit status. Sharing it is the collision
//        hermit#2558 introduced 125 to escape, so 125 must never drift back.
//   124  GNU `timeout`'s "deadline fired", and dev-hermit's `bin/safehermit`
//        uses it for its WALL DEADLINE kill. `tests/cli.rs` asserts
//        `assert_ne!(code, Some(124))` on the awk-mincore probe for that reason.
//   126  hermit's own GUEST_PROGRAM_NOT_EXECUTABLE_EXIT.
//   127  hermit's own GUEST_PROGRAM_NOT_FOUND_EXIT -- already in use for the
//        ABSOLUTE-PATH form of a missing guest program. Note the bare-name form
//        resolved against the guest PATH exits 125 instead, which is an
//        inconsistency filed separately, not a licence to reuse 127.
//
//   125  ⚠️ NOT FREE. dev-hermit's `bin/safehermit` exits 125 to mean "the LOG
//        BYTE CAP fired: safehermit killed the run through its cgroup"
//        (`demos/lib/demo_common.py`'s SAFEHERMIT_EXIT_REASON). Any hermit run
//        launched through that wrapper -- which is how the demos and the repeat
//        harness run it -- can therefore produce 125 for two unrelated reasons:
//        hermit refused, or the wrapper killed it for log volume. They demand
//        opposite responses (fix the invocation vs raise the cap), and `$?`
//        cannot tell them apart. This is a LIVE ambiguity, not a hypothetical:
//        demo 5 has been observed reporting `exited with status 125` when the
//        cap fired. It is recorded here rather than resolved because changing
//        either value is a cross-repository decision.
//
//        The discriminator meanwhile is the same one that separates hermit's 125
//        from a guest's own 125: the `HERMIT_INTERNAL_FAILURE` marker on stderr,
//        present only when hermit itself failed. safehermit writes its verdict
//        to its `--sh-report` file instead. Read one of those, never the number
//        alone.
//
// ⚠️ 0 IS THE DANGEROUS DRIFT, NOT 126 OR 127. Every one of these is asserted as
// `assert_eq!(code, Some(CONST))`. At 0 those assertions would stop demanding a
// FAILURE and start demanding a SUCCESS, and would still pass -- sixteen tests
// silently inverted. `tests/cli.rs` also asserts `!status.success()` beside the
// code for that reason; this pin is the second of the two locks.

/// checked through their interpreter, read as the kernel's script handler
/// reads it ([`script::KernelScript`]). A program or interpreter that is not a
/// regular file is refused before it is opened: the kernel executes only
/// regular files, opening a device can act on it, opening a socket fails, and
/// reading a FIFO that has no writer would block the check.
///
/// Every fact about one file (its type, header, ELF headers, mode bits and

/// - Secure-execution mode that a security module or a parent with differing
///   real and effective IDs imposes; only the file's own mode bits and
///   capabilities are checked.
/// - Whether the `PT_INTERP` loader honours `LD_PRELOAD` at all.
/// - A `binfmt_misc` rule, which the kernel consults before its ELF and script
///   handlers, and which can hand a file this check accepted to another
///   interpreter (for example an emulator).
/// - A runtime library the loader fails to load: the loader continues without
///   it, and only the launch's check that the guest connected before it exited
///   reports the failure, after the guest ran.

// to move together, because both readers derive it from the same fact. When the reserved set grew to include the signal
// band, `Exited(130)` fell outside `122..=127` and is NOT `Signaled(_, _)` --
// it is a status hermit CHOSE, not an actual signal death -- so LiteInst
// skipped the forced shutdown and `clean_up` could wait forever on
// `handle.await` (detcore/src/tool_global.rs). The reserved set had grown past
// the range this hard-coded, and nothing connected the two.
//
// Keying the SIGNAL HALF on `signal_from_exit_status` -- the same predicate
// `classify_container_result` uses -- is what stops that half drifting again: a
// change to the band moves both readers or neither.
//
// ⚠️ THE TWO PREDICATES ARE NOT THE SAME SET, AND AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS
// COMMENT SAID THEY WERE. agent(hermit-007)'s codex lane caught the overclaim.
// They deliberately differ:
//
//   this predicate            122..=127        +  signal band  +  real Signaled
//   classify_container_result 122 + 123 + 124  +  signal band
//
// 123..=127 force a LiteInst shutdown and are classified as NEITHER a refusal
// nor a signal death. The classifier gives 123 and 124 arms of their own -- 123
// is the log byte cap (hermit's `--max-log-bytes`, and the value reserved for
// safehermit's log-cap kill, which still exits 125), 124 a deadline hermit
// enforced -- while 125 (hermit itself) and 126/127 (exec-level) have none, and
// each has a different producer. Only the signal half is shared, and only the
// signal half is protected from drift. Do not "simplify" this by assuming the
