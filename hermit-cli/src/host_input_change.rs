//! Name a host file that changed during one verification run.
//!
//! Each run of `hermit run --verify` records the host identity of every file
//! the guest opens, in order, with the open that found it (see
//! `detcore_model::host_input`). A file that a run opens several times shows a
//! PATTERN of identities: each open finds an identity it has found at that
//! path before, or a new one. A file the guest itself creates, rewrites or
//! replaces changes at the same opens in both runs, even though its host inode
//! numbers and times differ between them. So the two runs' patterns agree
//! unless something outside the guest changed a file underneath one run: that
//! run finds a new identity at an open where the other run found a known one.
//!
//! Only one kind of change is named: the file was REPLACED, so the open found
//! a different host inode (`dev`, `ino`). Hermit mints deterministic inodes in
//! the order it first sees host inodes, so a replacement gives that run one
//! more inode and shifts every later deterministic inode number, whatever the
//! guest does with the file. A change of size or time alone is not named.
//!
//! A pattern difference is evidence of a host change only if the runs had not
//! diverged yet. A guest that behaves differently in the two runs can, for
//! example, replace a file in one run only, and then the patterns differ too,
//! but that behaviour shows in the compared log before the open. So the
//! difference names the cause of a divergence only when the comparison
//! compared everything (one strict enough for bitwise parity) and the open
//! that found it completed, in BOTH runs' logs, before the scheduler commit
//! preceding the first divergent record ([`explains_divergence`]): up to that
//! commit both runs did the same things, so the guest did not cause the
//! difference.
//!
//! Nothing else is concluded. The walk stops at the first open whose path,
//! thread or syscall differs between the runs and at the first difference that
//! is not a replacement, an incomplete log names nothing, an open whose finish
//! record a log does not show exactly once is not placed, and paths below
//! `/proc`, `/sys` and `/dev` are skipped: those are kernel objects whose
//! metadata is not file content and which Hermit virtualizes separately.
