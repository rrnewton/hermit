/// In both modes, the host file system is visible
/// to the command run inside hermit, and the results will depend on the contents
/// (but not timestamps or inode numbers) of those inputs.
///
/// In run mode, the guest's clock is virtual and starts at the epoch given by
/// `--epoch` or `HERMIT_EPOCH`. If neither is given, `hermit run` starts it at
/// the host's current time, so time values differ from one invocation to the
/// next. Pass a fixed epoch (for example `--epoch=2026-01-01T00:00:00Z`) when
/// two runs must produce identical time values.
///
/// In run and record mode, by default (`--network=local`), the guest gets its
/// own network namespace with only a loopback interface. `--network=host`
/// exposes the host network, which gives up isolation and reproducibility. A
/// recording stores its choice, and `hermit replay --autopilot` replays in the
/// same network; `hermit record start --verify-with-gdbex` defaults to, and
/// requires, `--network=host`. The DBT backend does not apply `--network` yet:
/// its guest sees the host network
/// (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3543).
///
/// In record mode, the guest's system call results are saved so that
/// `hermit replay` can reproduce the execution. Recordings are stored in
/// `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/hermit`, which is `~/.cache/hermit` when XDG_CACHE_HOME is
/// unset; `--data-dir` or `HERMIT_DATA_DIR` selects another directory.
