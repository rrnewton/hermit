//! Hermit's KVM run, and the one place its Detcore instantiation is rooted.
//!
//! `detcore::Detcore` under `reverie_kvm`'s tool runtime is a large
//! instantiation. In its own crate it builds in a separate rustc process,
//! beside the other backends' instantiations. The entry point,
//! [`run_detcore`], is not generic and returns a boxed future, so its callers
//! instantiate nothing of it (see `hermit-record` for why it is boxed).
//!
//! `reverie_kvm` is an x86-64 VMM and empty elsewhere, and so is this crate.
