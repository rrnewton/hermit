/*
 * Regression guard for the PR #1095 clock freeze.
 *
 * #1095 ("detcore: normalize guest clock after exec") gave each process a
 * GuestClock that subtracted a per-exec origin and re-added the configured
 * epoch, and reset that origin in handle_post_exec. The consequence was that
 * the FIRST clock read after EVERY exec returned exactly the epoch.
 *
 * That is why it survived review: a frozen clock reads IDENTICALLY across
 * processes and across backends, so it arrives looking like a parity WIN. A
 * check that samples the clock once per process cannot see it at all --
 * the first reads agree perfectly, which is precisely the bug.
 *
 * So this guard deliberately does the things such a check does not:
 *   1. it reads REPEATEDLY inside each generation, not once,
 *   2. it carries the previous generation's readings ACROSS AN EXEC and
 *      asserts continuity over that boundary,
 *   3. it brackets fixed amounts of guest work with reads, so committed
 *      progress is visible in the trajectory, and
 *   4. it samples from threads that run one at a time (each is joined before
 *      the next starts), so a per-thread clock origin or reset is visible
 *      while the emitted order stays deterministic without a scheduler.
 *
 * It must also not be satisfiable by making time COARSER -- that would be the
 * defect guarding itself. Note where that property actually comes from: every
 * leg below (round origin, strict advance, cross-exec continuity, distinct
 * per-exec origins, cross-thread continuity) is BROKEN by coarsening rather
 * than satisfied by it, so coarsening can never buy a pass here.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO absolute nanosecond floor on the gap between reads.
 * An earlier draft asserted one and it was wrong: the per-read advance is a
 * function of the run configuration, measured at ~10us under
 * `--strict --base-env=minimal` and ~5ms under the portable verify profile.
 * A constant calibrated on one of those fails the other, which would make this
 * guard a source of false reds rather than a detector of the defect. For the
 * same reason the work segments only assert that time advanced: exact costs
 * depend on the epoch, the timeslice, and the backend, none of which this
 * program controls. (Record mode currently refuses its clock_gettime.) Exact
 * virtual-time relations between segments belong to callers that pin those
 * inputs and compare whole trajectories.
 *
 * Which clock carries which claim follows Linux. Every leg above reads
 * CLOCK_MONOTONIC, which Linux keeps system-wide: it continues across exec and
 * threads and never steps, but its absolute value (time since an unspecified
 * point) is not a contract. Only CLOCK_REALTIME is defined relative to the Unix
 * epoch, so the two `realtime` records below, one after the opening
 * MONOTONIC reads and one after the threads, are the only reads a caller may
 * compare against a configured `--epoch`. No record relates the two clocks.
 * Hermit currently answers every clockid with the same epoch-anchored value
 * (handle_clock_gettime in detcore/src/syscalls/time.rs ignores the clockid);
 * that is a known deviation from Linux, tracked as TaskGraph task
 * hermit-clock-gettime-ignores-clockid, and nothing here may depend on it.
 *
 * Every stdout line before the final verdict is one closed trajectory record:
 *   sample gen=G source=main index=I ns=T
 *   realtime gen=G phase=open ns=T
 *   work gen=G index=I iterations=N before_ns=T after_ns=T checksum=X
 *   sample gen=G source=thread index=I thread=K ns=T
 *   realtime gen=G phase=close ns=T
 *   gen=G first=T last=T min_delta=D
 * Records appear in the order the reads happened. Within each clock, every
 * timestamp in emission order is strictly greater than that clock's previous
 * one, including across exec and thread boundaries; the fixture itself asserts
 * this for CLOCK_MONOTONIC and leaves the REALTIME anchors to callers.
 *
 * Usage (the guest re-execs itself; the arguments are internal):
 *   clock_exec_continuity [generation prev_last_ns gen0_first_ns]
