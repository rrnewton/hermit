 * Two threads for hermit-cli/tests/cli.rs's relative happens-before anchor
 * tests. The main thread (A) writes "a1" and "a2", makes three getppid calls,
 * then writes "A-after". A pthread worker (B) writes "B".
 *
 * - "order" (the default): B first makes 200 sched_yield calls, so in the
 *   natural schedule A finishes before B writes. A spec that holds A at "the
 *   first getppid after its second write" until B's write reverses that.
 * - "spin": B spins, with no syscalls, until A has passed its first getppid
 *   after "a2", then writes. Holding A there until B's write can never be
 *   satisfied, and B never ends its turn by itself; only the preemption timer
 *   lets virtual time run, so the hold budget ends the run.
