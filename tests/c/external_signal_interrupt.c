 * `select` is glibc's, which issues pselect6 with no mask; `rawselect` is the
 * select system call itself. `sem` is glibc's sem_timedwait, a FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET
 * with an absolute CLOCK_REALTIME deadline 10 s away (300 ms for a
 * must-not-wake option).
 *
 * The main thread installs a SIGUSR1 and SIGALRM handler (SA_RESTART only
 * with `restart`), prints READY, and blocks in the chosen call until the
 * signal arrives:
 *   external: from outside Hermit; the harness signals this process.
 *   process:  from a forked guest process that stays alive after kill().
 *             For wait4/waitid it is the waited child, blocked on a pipe;
 *             with `restart` it instead exits 100 ms after its kill(), so a
 *             wait that Linux restarts under SA_RESTART returns the child
 *             (printed as ret=child for wait4) near 200 ms, and a HANDLED_AT
 *             line after ELAPSED reports when the handler first ran (-1 if
 *             it never did): near 100 ms when the signal interrupted the wait.
 *   thread:   from a sibling thread with pthread_kill(). The thread waits,
 *             boundedly, for the handler to run (exiting 93 with
 *             WAKER_TIMEOUT if it never does), then sets the futex word and
 *             wakes the futex, so an SA_RESTART futex wait that Linux
 *             restarts still returns.
 *   timer:    SIGALRM from a 100 ms ITIMER_REAL, which Hermit's scheduler
 *             delivers itself.
 *   exit:     SIGCHLD, caught from the start, from a forked child that exits
 *             after 100 ms. Hermit's scheduler delivers the child-exit SIGCHLD;
 *             the kernel also posts its own at a host-timed moment.
 * `timed` gives the futex wait a relative timeout far beyond the signal.
 *
 * The last three options send a signal that must NOT end the wait: SIGUSR1
 * with SIG_IGN (`ignored`), SIGUSR1 blocked by the waiter (`blocked`), or
 * SIGWINCH, which is ignored by default (`winch`). The call then has a 300 ms
 * timeout, the sender does not wake the futex, and an ELAPSED line reports the
 * CLOCK_MONOTONIC time from just before the senders start until the call
 * returns, so the wait must run to its deadline.
 *
 * `tstp` is a fourth such option, with one exception. The guest first forks,
 * and the child runs the whole test after setsid(), which makes it the only
 * member of a new session and process group. That group is orphaned: no
 * member has a parent in another group of the same session. The sender then
 * sends SIGTSTP, left at SIG_DFL. Linux discards a SIG_DFL SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN or
 * SIGTTOU in an orphaned process group instead of stopping the process, and
 * restarts a call the signal interrupted. poll, select, a timed futex and
 * sem_timedwait restart with their original deadline, so they too return at
 * 300 ms; epoll_wait is the exception and returns EINTR when the signal
 * arrives. The parent prints nothing and exits with the child's status.
 *
 * The next seven options change a disposition, or queue a signal, while the
 * waiter is already parked; they need the `thread` sender. The sibling thread blocks SIGUSR1 and
 * SIGCHLD, so only the waiter can take the signal, and after 100 ms it:
 *   ign2caught: installs the SIGUSR1 handler over SIG_IGN, then pthread_kill.
 *   caught2ign: sets SIGUSR1 to SIG_IGN over the handler, then pthread_kill.
 *   chldlate:   installs a SIGCHLD handler over SIG_DFL, then forks a child
 *               that exits at once.
 *   chldign:    resets a caught SIGCHLD to SIG_DFL (ignored by default), then
 *               forks a child that exits at once.
 *   chldkill:   as chldlate, but the child dies by sending itself SIGKILL.
 *   chldthrexit: as chldlate, but the child's only thread calls the exit
 *               system call rather than exit_group.
 *   chldpend:   leaves SIGCHLD at its default disposition, forks a child that
 *               exits at once and reaps it, so that child's SIGCHLD is pending
 *               on the process's shared queue (a traced process queues even a
 *               signal it ignores), where only the waiter can take it; then
 *               pthread_kill(SIGUSR1). The waiter has a caught signal and a
 *               default-ignored SIGCHLD pending together.
 * chldkill and chldthrexit end the child without exit_group, so Hermit's
 * scheduler sends no child-exit SIGCHLD of its own: the only SIGCHLD is the
 * kernel's, which the scheduler makes eligible at the child's logical death.
 * ign2caught, chldlate, chldkill, chldthrexit and chldpend must end the wait
 * with EINTR near 100 ms; the sibling wakes the futex (and writes the pipe)
 * only after the handler ran.
 * caught2ign and chldign must not end it: a `timed` wait then returns at its
 * original 300 ms deadline, and an untimed one is ended by the sibling's
 * FUTEX_WAKE (or pipe write) 200 ms after the signal.
 *
 * `exit` and these seven options also print the ELAPSED line.
 *
 * The remaining options add a sibling thread that does NOT block SIGCHLD, so
 * the kernel may deliver a child's SIGCHLD to it instead of to the waiter.
 * Linux's complete_signal() offers a process-directed signal first to the
 * thread it names, which for a child's SIGCHLD is the thread that forked the
 * child, and takes it if that thread does not block the signal and is running
 * or has no signal pending; otherwise it tries the other threads. The SIGCHLD
 * handler is installed from the start, and a HANDLER line reports how many
 * times it ran on the main thread and on the sibling. The child dies by
 * exit_group (`...grp`, or `spin`), by sending itself SIGKILL (`...kill`), or
 * by its only thread calling the exit system call (`...threxit`).
 *   steal*:  `thread` sender. After 100 ms the sibling forks a child that dies
 *            at once and stays runnable, calling sched_yield (which gives up
 *            the CPU but does not block), until the handler has run. The
 *            forking sibling takes the SIGCHLD, so
 *            the waiter keeps waiting: a `timed` wait (300 ms) returns
 *            ETIMEDOUT at its original deadline, and an untimed one is ended
 *            by the sibling's FUTEX_WAKE 100 ms after the handler ran.
 *   fork*:   `thread` sender and `timed`. The sibling forks a child that dies
 *            after 100 ms, then parks in its own 300 ms FUTEX_WAIT. The forking
 *            sibling takes the SIGCHLD: its wait ends with EINTR near 100 ms,
 *            reported on a SIBLING line, and the main thread's 300 ms wait
 *            runs to ETIMEDOUT.
 *   spin*:   `exit` sender. The main thread forks the child, which dies after
 *            100 ms, and starts a sibling that sleeps 50 ms, so the main thread
 *            is already waiting, and then spins in user code, with no system
 *            calls, until the handler has run. The forking main thread is
 *            waiting, so it takes the SIGCHLD and its wait ends with EINTR.
 *            For an untimed wait the sibling then wakes the futex, so a wait
 *            that lost the signal to the sibling returns 0 instead of hanging.
 *
 * `held` states the expectation of a Hermit whose gated waits hold a caught
 * SIGCHLD until the call returns, as Hermit's main branch does: the SIGCHLD
 * cannot end the wait, so the wait needs another way to end. It goes with
 * the `exit` sender and futex, poll or epoll (a `spin*` role included), or
 * with chldlate, chldkill and chldthrexit. With `exit`, the call gets the
 * 300 ms timeout of a must-not-wake option, timed or not. With a SIGCHLD
 * flip, the sibling does not wait for the handler: as for chldign, a `timed`
 * wait returns at its 300 ms deadline, and the sibling wakes an untimed one
 * 200 ms after the signal. Either way the handler runs once the call has
 * returned, so the RESULT line reports it. Linux instead ends the wait with
 * EINTR when the SIGCHLD arrives, so these cells hold only under Hermit.
 *
 * `warm` issues the waiting call's own system-call instruction once before the
 * wait, so a backend that patches a call site on its first execution (LiteInst)
 * runs the wait through the patched site: syscall(SYS_gettid) for `futex`,
 * `rawselect`, `wait4` and `waitid`, which then share glibc's syscall()
 * instruction (with `warm`, wait4 and waitid are issued through syscall()
 * rather than their glibc wrappers), and a 10 ms sem_timedwait that must time
 * out for `sem`.
 *
 * `usr2` needs the `external` sender, which then sends SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2
 * back to back: SIGUSR2 is caught too, and after the RESULT line the guest
 * waits, boundedly, for both handlers and prints how often each ran on a
 * HANDLED line (`HANDLED usr1=1 usr2=1` when neither signal was lost).
 *
 * `extchld`, `extchldreaped` and `extchldlive` need the `external` sender and
 * the `select` or `rawselect` call, whose wait is then unbounded. The guest
 * catches SIGCHLD (flags 0), and the harness sends SIGCHLD rather than SIGUSR1
 * with kill(2), so its siginfo code is SI_USER, not a child event.
 *   extchld:       the process never has a child.
 *   extchldreaped: before READY the guest forks a child that exits at once and
 *                  reaps it, sets SIGCHLD to SIG_DFL, which discards that
 *                  child's SIGCHLD if it is still pending, and only then
 *                  installs the handler, so the handler cannot run for it.
 *   extchldlive:   before READY the guest forks a child that stays blocked
 *                  reading a pipe until the guest closes the pipe after the
 *                  RESULT line. The child first changes its copy of argv[0],
 *                  so the harness, which looks the guest up by argv[0],
 *                  signals the parent alone.
 * Linux ends the wait with EINTR as soon as the signal arrives, with or
 * without a child, and the handler has run once by the RESULT line.
 *
 * `chldflood` needs the `external` sender and `poll`, or `futex` with `timed`.
 * SIGCHLD stays at SIG_DFL, which ignores it. After READY the guest naps in
 * 1 ms sleeps until its SIGUSR1 handler has run, then takes the start stamp and
 * makes the call with the 300 ms timeout of a must-not-wake option. The harness
 * sends SIGUSR1 followed by a flood of SIGCHLD, so the wait starts while
 * SIGCHLD keeps arriving. A default-ignored SIGCHLD neither ends nor restarts
 * the wait on Linux, so poll returns 0 and the futex wait ETIMEDOUT at 300 ms,
 * and the ELAPSED line reports it.
 *
 * `sigsuspend creator` is a mode of its own. The main thread installs a
 * SIGCHLD handler (flags 0), blocks SIGCHLD, prints READY and waits in
 * pthread_join for a second thread, the creator, which inherits that mask. Six times, the creator
 * forks a child that exits 50 ms later with the trial number as its status,
 * and sleeps in sigsuspend with SIGCHLD unblocked. Linux sends the child's
 * SIGCHLD to the thread that forked it when that thread does not block it, so
 * the handler runs on the creator and sigsuspend returns -1 with EINTR once
 * the child has exited. The creator then reaps the child and sets SIGCHLD to
 * SIG_IGN and back to the handler, which discards any second SIGCHLD left
 * pending for the same exit. Each trial prints a TRIAL line (whether the wait
 * ended after the child's exit, the call's result, how often the handler ran,
 * whether it ran on the creator, and the reaped status), then one RESULT line
 * counts the trials that matched Linux.
 *
 * The `racing` and `racingchld` senders are modes of their own, for a call
 * that does not wait: a readable pipe for poll, ppoll (no mask), epoll and
 * epollpwait (epoll_wait and epoll_pwait with no mask, on an epoll set holding
 * that pipe), select and rawselect, epoll_wait with maxevents 0 for
 * epollinval, epoll_wait on a descriptor that is not open for epollbadf,
 * select and rawselect on that descriptor for selectbadf and rawselectbadf,
 * and rt_sigtimedwait with a set pointer that cannot be read for
 * sigtimedwaitfault; every call has a 5 s timeout. Six times, the main thread
 * starts a thread that waits for a flag, yields the trial number of times, and
 * sends a caught signal (flags 0) to the main thread with tgkill, SIGUSR1 for
 * `racing` and SIGCHLD for `racingchld`; the main thread sets the flag and
 * makes the call. Linux reports a ready descriptor or an argument error before
 * it looks at pending signals (do_poll, ep_poll, do_epoll_wait,
 * core_sys_select, whose max_select_fd rejects a descriptor that is not open,
 * and rt_sigtimedwait copies its set first), so whenever the signal arrives
 * the call returns 1 with the pipe's event, or -1 with EINVAL, EBADF or
 * EFAULT, and the handler runs once by the time the thread is joined. Each
 * trial prints a TRIAL line, then one RESULT line counts the trials that
 * matched Linux.
 *
 * The `stopcont` and `stopcontusr1` senders are modes of their own, for poll
 * (no descriptors) and a relative FUTEX_WAIT, each with the QUIET_TIMEOUT_MS
 * timeout. The guest forks a child, prints READY and waits. The child sends the
 * guest SIGSTOP 100 ms later and SIGCONT 100 ms after that. No handler runs for
 * either, so Linux restarts the call through the restart block it saved
 * (do_restart_poll, futex_wait_restart), which keeps the original absolute
 * deadline: the call returns 0 (poll) or -1 with ETIMEDOUT (futex) once that
 * deadline passes, QUIET_TIMEOUT_MS after it began, not a full timeout after
 * SIGCONT (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3358). With `stopcontusr1`
 * the child also sends SIGUSR1, caught with flags 0, 50 ms after SIGCONT, which
 * must still end the restarted wait: Linux returns -1 with EINTR when a handler
 * interrupts a restarted wait. The child exits only after the call's deadline,
 * so the SIGCHLD of its exit never arrives during the wait. The ELAPSED line
 * reports how long the call took. The `bitset` call is a FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET
 * whose absolute CLOCK_MONOTONIC deadline, QUIET_TIMEOUT_MS after the call
 * began, is in memory shared with the child; just before SIGSTOP the child
 * moves it 200 ms later. Linux copied the deadline when the wait began and
 * restarts the call with that copy (futex_wait_restart), so the move has no
 * effect and the call returns -1 with ETIMEDOUT at the original deadline.
 *
 * The `restartfirst` sender is a mode of its own, for the relative FUTEX_WAIT
 * (`futex`) and the absolute FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET (`bitset`), each made through
 * libc's syscall() with the QUIET_TIMEOUT_MS timeout. A sibling thread sends
 * the guest's main thread SIGUSR1, caught with flags 0, 100 ms after the wait
 * began, and the handler's first syscall is syscall(SYS_restart_syscall), made
 * through the same wrapper, so it stops at the interrupted call's address.
 * Linux resets the thread's restart block only at sigreturn
 * (restore_sigcontext), not when it sets up the handler, so that call runs
 * futex_wait_restart: it waits until the original absolute deadline and
 * returns -1 with ETIMEDOUT, and the interrupted call then returns -1 with
 * EINTR. A RESTART line reports the handler's call, and the ELAPSED line, as
 * for the interrupted call, ends after the handler has returned.
 *
 * Output is one deterministic RESULT line after the call returns, followed
 * by DONE once every helper has been reaped. A kernel-internal errno, which has
 * no name, prints as UNNAMED(<number>). */
