/*
 * Link-time cpuset for the identity-fixture family's CPU-placement leg.
 *
 * A validation host may run a fixture inside a cgroup cpuset that leaves out
 * some CPUs. The dev-hermit validate launcher does this on purpose: it keeps
 * cells off the CPUs the host PMU drivers are bound to, CPU 0 among them
 * (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3265). Inside such a cpuset the
 * kernel intersects every sched_setaffinity(2) request with the cpuset and
 * fails the call with EINVAL when nothing is left. A fixture that asks for a
 * fixed CPU number therefore passes on one host and fails on another.
 *
 * Restricting only the inherited affinity mask does not reproduce that: the
 * kernel lets a process widen its own mask again to any CPU in its cpuset, so a
 * fixture that asks for CPU 0 still gets it. And an unprivileged harness cannot
 * create a cpuset. fixture_mutation.py instead links a fixture with
 * `-Wl,--wrap=sched_setaffinity` and this file, starts it with its affinity
 * restricted to one CPU, and this wrapper applies the kernel's cpuset rule:
 *
 *   the effective mask is the request intersected with the cpuset the process
 *   started in (its inherited affinity), and an empty intersection is EINVAL.
 *
 * A fixture that asks only for CPUs it may already use is unaffected. The
 * wrapper covers calls through the glibc symbol, which is how every family
 * member calls it; a raw syscall(SYS_sched_setaffinity, ...) would bypass it.
 *
 * Built with -DFIXTURE_CPUSET_SHIM_CONTROL, this file is also the leg's
 * control: a program that asks for each CPU named on its command line. The
 * harness names a CPU from its own affinity mask but outside the one CPU it
 * starts the control on; the kernel would accept that request, so an EINVAL can
 * only come from the wrapper. Without that negative, a wrapper that stopped
 * refusing would turn the placement leg into a second unrestricted run. The
 * harness also names the allowed CPU, which must succeed, so a wrapper that
 * refuses everything is caught by the control rather than by every fixture.
