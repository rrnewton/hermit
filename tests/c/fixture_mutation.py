"""Shared mutation harness for the identity-fixture family in tests/c.

This harness moved here from tests/backend-parity/parity_mutation.py, with its
fixtures, when the backend-parity-c manifest bucket was folded into c-programs
(https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3301, slice S6).

The family of identity fixtures (rlimit_identity_probe.c,
sched_getaffinity_identity_probe.c, ioctl_fionread.c, ...) all make the same claim:
"every backend observes the same value the golden ptrace reference does." That
claim is only worth anything if the fixture would actually FAIL when a backend
gets the value wrong. Historically each fixture hand-rolled its own
both-direction proof, and a hand-rolled proof is a chance to write one that
cannot fail -- the vacuous-test shape. (Measured on the reverie staging batch:
5 of 5 members had tests that passed WITHOUT exercising their mechanism, and 4
of those 5 hid a real product bug.)

This harness gives the whole family ONE verification, so a new member cannot
drift into vacuity. Each member supplies only:

  * its syscall           -- the fixture .c source, and
  * its divergence        -- the name(s) of the mutable field(s) it threads
                             through the parity_mutate_*() seam in parity_probe.h.

The harness then proves, for every member, BOTH directions:

  (a) plant a divergence   -- run the fixture with HERMIT_PARITY_MUTATE naming a
      -> assert FAILURE        field. The seam perturbs that field's observed
                               value, so the fixture's (exit status, stdout)
                               must diverge from the clean golden run. If it does
                               NOT diverge, the field is not actually load-bearing
                               and the fixture is VACUOUS -- the harness fails.
  (b) run clean            -- run the fixture unperturbed under a candidate
      -> assert PASS           backend. Its (exit status, stdout) must MATCH the
                               golden ptrace reference. A mismatch is a real
                               backend-parity defect.

"Parity means matching the GOLDEN PTRACE REFERENCE," so ptrace is the default
comparison target in hermit mode, not something each fixture re-states.

Two run modes:

  * Native self-test (default; C compiler only, no hermit build). The reference
    is a clean native execution; the mutation direction proves each declared
    field is load-bearing, and the clean direction proves the fixture's contract
    holds. This is the cheap CI guard that catches a vacuous family member on
    every PR without building hermit.
  * Hermit cross-backend (with --hermit). Adds the REAL parity check: each
    candidate backend's clean run must match the golden ptrace run, and a
    divergence planted in that backend must be caught. A backend that cannot run
    (e.g. KVM without /dev/kvm) is SKIPPED with a reported reason -- never a
    silent pass -- unless --require-backend makes the skip fatal.

Native mode also runs a CPU-placement leg: every fixture's clean contract must
still hold on a host that lets it use exactly one CPU, and not its lowest one.
Validation hosts do restrict CPUs this way. The dev-hermit launcher keeps cells
off the CPUs the host PMU drivers are bound to, CPU 0 among them
(https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3265), and a fixture that pinned
itself to CPU 0 failed there while passing everywhere else. An unprivileged
harness cannot create the cgroup cpuset that causes this, so the leg links the
fixture with fixture_cpuset_shim.c, which applies the kernel's cpuset rule to
sched_setaffinity, and first proves with that file's control program that the
rule refuses a CPU the kernel itself would have accepted.

Adding a family member is one registry entry below: source path + field names.
No bespoke verification code travels with the fixture.

The family is exactly the set of tests/c sources that include parity_probe.h.
The harness refuses to run if that set and the registry differ, so a fixture
that adopts the seam cannot go unexamined and a registry entry cannot point at
a file that left the family. Every run prints the fixtures it examined.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Strictness tiers
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# "Parity" is not one predicate. A green must say WHICH streams it compared,
# because a green that does not is exactly how the predecessor reported PASS
# for a mutation it never looked at. Each tier is a superset of the one below.
#
#   TIER-1  exit status + stdout
#   TIER-2  + stderr
#   TIER-3  + the unstripped hermit INFO log
#   TIER-4  + stack/heap observations (not yet produced by this harness)
#
# RELATIONSHIP TO THE PRODUCT'S OWN L-LEVELS, stated so the two vocabularies do
# not silently drift apart. `hermit run --strict --verify --verify-strict`
# establishes L2 under the `BitwiseInfoV1` policy (detcore/src/logdiff.rs), and
# that is the authority for what "bitwise" means in this repository. But
# --verify compares a backend against ITSELF on a repeat run; it cannot compare
# one backend against another, which is what parity means here. So this harness
# is not a substitute for --verify-strict and does not reimplement it -- it
# applies the same idea across backends.
#
# TIER-2 corresponds to what KVM's --verify can currently assert (exit status,
# stdout, stderr) and TIER-3 to the full-INFO envelope, which is why the repo
# says KVM "cannot claim full L2 INFO parity until internal log comparison
# exists".
#
# KNOWN GAP, and it is deliberate rather than overlooked: BitwiseInfoV1 both
# removes the wall-clock prefix AND ordinalizes host addresses marked with the
# `<hostaddr 0x...>` wrapper, preserving identity and order. TIER-3 here does
# only the wall-clock part. That makes TIER-3 CONSERVATIVE: an unmarked host
# address differing between runs reports a parity BREAK that BitwiseInfoV1
# would forgive. It can therefore understate an achieved tier, never overstate
# one -- a false negative, not a false green. Adopting the product
# canonicalizer here is the right follow-up; until then, read a TIER-2 result
# as "TIER-2 or better".
#
# Cross-backend note, and it is the reason tiers exist rather than one boolean:
# different backends legitimately emit different INFO logs (backend name,
# interception detail), so requiring TIER-3 equality between the ptrace golden
# and a candidate would be red everywhere for reasons that are not parity
# defects. A lane that is red everywhere gets disabled wholesale. So a
# cross-backend cell REPORTS the highest tier it achieves; it does not pretend
# to a tier it cannot reach. Same-backend legs (golden vs mutated) are held to
# the fixture's top supported tier, because there the log genuinely should match.
