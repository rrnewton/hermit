# Regression test for the cache in bootstrap/regenerate-rust-deps
# (bootstrap/rust-deps-cache.sh).
#
# Runs the real regenerate-rust-deps, cache functions and key helper
# (rust-deps-cache-key.rs, run from this checkout against the fixture) in a
# fixture checkout whose cargo, Reindeer, feature check and reverie-dbt patch
# are stubs; the
# Reindeer stub logs each call and derives its output from Cargo.lock. Accept:
# the first run vendors and stores an entry; a second run with the same inputs
# calls Reindeer not at all and leaves a byte-identical tree, with the
# postprocessing applied once. Re-vendor: a committed Cargo.lock that moves a
# git dependency to another commit, an edited reindeer.toml, a new untracked
# fixup, and a different cargo version each vendor again, and a lock moved back
# restores its earlier entry. Off: HERMIT_RUST_DEPS_CACHE=off always vendors
# and stores nothing. Eviction keeps the newest HERMIT_RUST_DEPS_CACHE_KEEP
# entries by last use. Damage: an entry whose vendored crates are gone is
# discarded, the run vendors, and the replacement entry serves the next run.
#
# Stale and partial entries: a run whose Reindeer rewrites Cargo.lock fails and
# stores nothing, so the original lock vendors again; a keyed input that changes
# while Reindeer runs stores nothing; a fixup Git ignores, a fixup reached
# through a directory link (its referent edited), a workspace member manifest
# Git ignores (also at a path JSON must escape), and the compiler's target cfg
# and version each change the key, and RUSTC names the compiler queried; a
# platform target written as a multi-line or escaped string, or under an escaped
# key, is queried as Reindeer decodes it; reindeer.toml settings the key cannot
# cover (fixups_dir, cargo.rustc, cargo.cargo, gitignore_checksum_exclude, an
# unknown key, no platform table), also under escaped keys, vendor without
# storing, while a multi-line string elsewhere and Hermit's own reindeer.toml
# keep the cache; a key that cannot be computed (cargo metadata failing or
# printing broken JSON, an unreadable directory under the third-party
# directory, a helper printing something other than a key or declining without
# a reason), before or after Reindeer runs, vendors without
# restoring or storing; an eviction whose removal fails part-way leaves no
# entry a restore accepts; an entry without its raw BUCK is not copied from and
# is replaced by the next publish; and a publish paused with its staging complete keeps that staging,
# however old, while another run publishes and removes abandoned staging, then
# stores an entry that restores.
