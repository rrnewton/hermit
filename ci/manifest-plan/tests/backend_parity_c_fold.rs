//! Pin the fold of the backend-parity-c bucket into c-programs.
//!
//! Slice S6 of <https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3301> deleted
//! `tests/e2e/manifests/backend-parity-c.yaml`, moved its 104 tests into
//! `tests/e2e/manifests/c-programs.yaml` and its fixtures into `tests/c`, and
//! recorded every old id in `tests/e2e/manifests/inventory/retired-ids.json`.
//! The fold is a rename, not a change of coverage. This file checks that from
//! four independent sides:
//!
//! 1. The retired-id map renames exactly the documented ids: every id is the
//!    bucket-prefix rename except the one collision, and it is a bijection onto
//!    live ids.
//! 2. The committed CI plan selects 1102 cells, with per-(lane, backend, mode)
//!    counts equal to the pre-fold plan's plus exactly the cells slice S13
//!    added (895 portable and 5 privileged), the 189 portable cells of the
//!    compatibility-corpus fold, the 2 portable select replay cells and the 6
//!    portable KVM verify selections, the three socket selections, and one
//!    poll-readiness and one epoll-pwait2 selection, after applying the later lane moves listed
//!    in `LATER_LANE_MOVES` (now 1095 portable and 7 privileged).
//! 3. The committed compatibility cell table has 14800 rows, with
//!    per-(backend, mode, status) counts equal to the pre-fold table's plus
//!    exactly the rows slice S13 added or reclassified and the 3024 rows of the
//!    compatibility-corpus fold, plus the 2 select replay and 6 KVM verify
//!    selection changes, plus three socket, one poll-readiness and one epoll-pwait2 selection,
//!    that keep the row total unchanged, plus the later SaBRe, strict and rr
//!    compatibility folds described below.
//! 4. The command the c-programs nodes run refuses a selection of zero cells,
//!    so folding more tests into that node cannot turn it into a vacuous pass.
//!
//! Two further checks pin slice S13's DAG edits: every manifest node that
//! selects a DBT cell and runs in one dagrun with check.dbt_runtime_abi orders
//! after it, as the retired test.dbt_parity node did, and the privileged
//! c-programs descriptions name the cells those nodes select.
//!
//! The pre-fold numbers are embedded, not recomputed: they were measured at
//! e8007f971a72c5fd92fcf3e17e41f38811c3cac3. The fold's parent on main is
//! 3f66a249b30fada86b81e722b8e5439ac0789f8e, the last commit that declared
//! backend-parity-c; the plan, the cell table and both manifests are
//! byte-identical at the two commits. A later change that moves a count has to
//! change this file and say why. Slice S13 of the same issue moved the retired
//! DBT backend-parity matrix onto manifest cells, and fold 1 of
//! <https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3448> moved the strict
//! compatibility corpus into the manifest; their counts are listed separately
//! below so the pre-fold snapshot stays byte-for-byte what was measured.
