//! `test-harness run` import mode: re-publish cell rows another runner wrote.
//!
//! With `E2E_IMPORT_RESULTS=<root>` the harness executes no cell. It reads the
//! rows that a Buck run of the same plan left under
//! `<root>/<lane>/manifest_<category>/results.jsonl` (the layout
//! `ci/buck-e2e/ingest.py` writes) and emits them through the normal
//! publication path, so `results.jsonl`, JUnit, `summary.json`, the retry
//! history and the dagrun test counts are produced exactly as for an executed
//! bucket. Every selected cell must be accounted for: a cell with no row and no
//! host inapplicability this machine confirms becomes an ERROR row. That is the
//! executed-equals-plan gate for an imported run, and nothing here may relax it.
//!
//! An imported cell may not end better than the same rows would have ended in
//! an executed run:
//!
//! - Every row must describe this commit's clean source, this checkout's test
//!   source, the current timeout policy, and (when the binary was stamped) a
//!   binary built from this commit. Otherwise the cell is one `import-stale`
//!   ERROR.
//! - The cell's rows, in file order, must be a history a producer writes:
//!   attempts 1, 2, ... within the shared attempt cap, nothing after a PASS,
//!   and no HOST-INAPPLICABLE row (a producer reports host inapplicability
//!   only in `summary.json`). Otherwise the cell is one `import-history`
//!   ERROR. This is checked on the whole history, before anything is dropped.
//! - The producer retries every failure; this run's retry policy decides which
//!   of those retries it would have made. History after a failed attempt (a
//!   FAIL or an ERROR) that does not earn a retry here is dropped, so that
//!   attempt is the cell's verdict.
//! - The policy is the decision an executed run applies to its own attempt
//!   (`attempt_retry_cause` in `test-harness`), applied to the imported row.
//!   For an ERROR that is the skid-overshoot retry
//!   (`skid_overshoot_only_reports`,
//!   <https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/1845>) or the host-input
//!   retry (`host_input_change_only`). Neither trusts the row's labels: each
//!   re-decides the attempt from the report bytes the row retains, which must
//!   match the row's `verification_report_sha256`, and the row must record
//!   the exit, stdout and relaxation declarations of this checkout's cell. So
//!   an imported skid-overshoot ERROR whose retained evidence decides it
//!   continues to its producer's next attempt, as an executed one would, and
//!   any other ERROR (an untyped one, a report that does not match its digest,
//!   another declaration) ends the history.
//! - A PASS counts only if the producer recorded complete evidence for the
//!   execution that passed: that row's run id in `evidence_complete_executions`
//!   in the bucket's `summary.json`. Evidence from another execution of the
//!   same cell does not count.
//! - A producer's host-inapplicable claim counts only if this machine lacks a
//!   capability the cell requires, and the row carries this machine's reason.
//!
//! An imported row is rebound to this run before publication: its `run_id`
//! (and the run id its CPU observations are bound to) becomes this run's, and
//! the observations' outer attempt follows the row's attempt, which the ingest
//! assigned from Tpx's execution order. Its `source_tree_dirty` is set when this
//! checkout is dirty, as an executed row's would be. The rows' original run ids
//! are kept and reported.
