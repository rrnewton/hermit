It first cleans and builds detcore-dbt alone, so reverie-dbt's DynamoRIO cache exists before hermit-install stages the DBT client, DynamoRIO, SaBRe, e9patch and the LiteInst runtime into target/install_pkg, then builds the whole workspace, all targets, with the union of the features every prepared Nextest selection names. Nothing in it runs a rust-script (run-with-reverie-dbt-budget.sh compiles its pin checks with rustc, and no build script calls one), so it does not wait for build.rust_scripts_in_pinned_root and the two compile side by side in the same pinned root, writing different target directories; it keeps the rust-script environment, with HERMIT_PREBUILT_RUST_SCRIPTS_REQUIRED=1, so a rust-script added here later fails at once instead of compiling or running unprepared. Its only consumer is build.workspace_in_pinned_root, which lists the executables this build produced. Until 2026-10-06 the two halves were one node that waited for the rust-script tools, about 183 seconds, before this 175-to-182-second Cargo phase began. preferred_inner_jobs=32 is kept from the cold measurement at hermit@846baeca.";

It hashes every listed executable and publishes all selections in one record, so no selection recompiles anything or relinks target/validate/hermit. Every consumer of the workspace build names this node, so none starts before that record exists. The budget is measured: in eight full validations on 2026-10-06 the unsplit node took 235 to 241 seconds, of which Cargo reported 45 to 46 for detcore-dbt and 130 to 136 for the workspace, leaving 58 to 60 seconds for container start and preparation. The CPU-wrapper build is the largest part, 27 to 28 seconds at 32 workers in those runs; a cold 16-worker build of it outside the root took 28 seconds, 135 CPU-seconds and a 2.4 GB memory peak.

// build.workspace, build.e2e_artifact, build.runtime_release and
// build.liteinst_runtime_release and the pinned-root build.runtime_release and
// build.liteinst_runtime_release, and both gained build.host_hermit_link:
// 278/279 and 265/266 before. privileged lost the host
// privileged-only-build.privileged_tests, whose pinned-root twin its consumers
// use: 12/20 before. hosted-portable lost
// build.runtime_release and build.liteinst_runtime_release_on_host, and
// check.dbt_runtime_abi became check.dbt_runtime_abi_on_host: 256/256 before.
// full, portable and hosted-portable then gained check.script_unit_tests, split

// (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3663): 87/88 before. portable and
// hosted-portable are unchanged because the node carries only the full label.
// full and portable then gained test.record_replay, the first node to run

// 74/75 before. hosted-portable is unchanged because the node has no hosted
// twin.
// full-buck-e2e is only the Buck E2E nodes; a Buck full run selects it with a
