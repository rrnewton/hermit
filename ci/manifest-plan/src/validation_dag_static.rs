const RUST_SCRIPT_PRODUCER_DESCRIPTION: &str = r########"DISCOVERED PRODUCER 2026-08-31: every tracked rust-script entrypoint is generated as a Cargo package, checked with the existing clippy policy, built as a release executable, and, when it carries tests, built as a test harness. The outputs are copied into target/ci/rust-scripts after checkout and pin verification, and all compiling consumers wait for this node. Repository graph commands resolve rust-script through ci/rust-script-bin, which executes only the published binaries and never invokes Cargo; sources owned by external operational tooling remain that tooling's responsibility. Two concurrent rust-script --force probes sharing one cache measured a real Cargo build-directory lock wait; separate caches removed the wait but duplicated compilation. Keeping one writer and read-only consumers makes compilation placement deterministic without creating per-node target directories. RESOURCE BOUNDS measured 2026-09-14 at Hermit 7b8be60708c29b4926f36f06be8793523841d6ba: the old 2-GiB hard cap killed the cold width-8 producer in run 1812 and in a focused width-4 control. With the unchanged 28-entrypoint/17-harness workload and width 8, three ordinary cold runs with memory.max=6442450944 bytes passed with cgroup peaks 3836551168, 3845783552, and 3841757184 bytes; three pinned-root cold runs under that same memory.max passed with peaks 3803856896, 3721408512, and 3691466752 bytes. All six recorded memory.events max=0, oom=0, and oom_kill=0. The 4-GiB baseline rounds above the measured high-water mark for scheduler accounting; the 6-GiB hard cap adds more than 2.4 GiB of runaway headroom while fitting the project's 8-GiB minimum runner. preferred_inner_jobs=8 remains paired with CARGO_BUILD_JOBS so the scheduler reserves the same eight-CPU width Cargo actually uses. WALL BOUND 2026-10-04: the producer's wall bound was 900 seconds, the width-8 wall equivalent of its unchanged 7200-second CPU bound. Across 22 local full validations of Hermit main between 2026-10-01 and 2026-10-04 the ordinary producer's wall peaked at 644.496 seconds (median 201.548), and the pinned-root producer's at 527.414 seconds. The peak run, at Hermit 972dd0ead8c440da3716e7c3ccf47f5eac34cc6e, used 1253.8 CPU seconds, 14% above the 1097.5-second median, over 3.2 times the median wall, so it reflects fewer available cores rather than more work. 900 seconds was 1.40 times that peak, below the project's rule that a limit be at least 1.5 times the largest observed use, so the wall bound is now 1200 seconds, the next 300-second bucket above 1.5 times 644.496 seconds (966.7). The ordinary, pinned-root, hosted-privileged on-host and quick/super producers share this constant. Quick and super use a distinct 1200-second CPU budget and zero duration estimate: 1200 is the next project 300-second bucket above 1.5 times the largest measured 737.730-second CPU sample. The Step constructor orders these as wall, CPU, then memory."########;

const MANIFEST_GATE_DESCRIPTION: &str = r########"SELF-TESTS MOVED OUT 2026-09-29: every product node waits on this gate, and the local validation of Hermit 98a621f42935d585e1306262b11d64488dd51614 was killed here by the 900-second CPU cap while the gate was still running repository-tool self-tests. Those self-tests (scorecard, pressure_test, validate_rs, manifest_cli, dbt_budget; TOOL_SELF_TESTS in validation_dag.rs) now run as selftest.<name> leaf nodes that still decide the verdict but block nothing. The gate keeps only what product nodes consume: the manifest-plan audits run in process (DAG/manifest correspondence, budget ordering, determinism-stress evidence, CLI brackets and the expected-cell plan, which define the cells and commands the product nodes execute), and `generate-test-footprints --check`, which proves the committed ci/test-footprints.json still matches ci/dag/validate.json and Cargo metadata, so hosted test selection picks product nodes from current data. Measured 2026-09-29 on the measurement host recorded for gate.manifest in docs/TESTING_ENVIRONMENTS.md ("Named measurement hosts") at load average 215-233: `test-harness validate` took 2.88 s wall and 2.53 CPU seconds (1.99 user, 0.54 system, 29440 KiB largest process RSS), against 664 s of wall before it was killed at 900 CPU seconds with the self-tests included. The 120 CPU seconds are 47 times that sample and bound a hang, not the work; the ordinary and quick/super gates share the constant. The 900-second wall is unchanged because the committed portable preflight critical path is built from it (3780 seconds, then 3900 once setup.manifest_plan's wall cap went from 180 to 300 seconds). HERMIT_VALIDATE_AUDIT_JOBS=1 and the two-core width are retained; with one remaining child audit they no longer change the schedule. The history below describes the former seven-audit gate. AUDIT WIDTH CONTRACT 2026-09-25: RUN1902 admitted this gate to a one-core cgroup but inherited CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4 from the outer validation environment. test-harness treated that unrelated value as the admitted width, launched two heavyweight metadata audits, and the scorecard's unchanged five-second snapshot command control was starved and killed after producing no output. The retained step profile recorded 0.9264 effective cores and 380.573 seconds throttled. Cold isolated controls at Hermit 22e9e0b5 and ecb3c9a5 passed with the original five-second boundary; concurrent one-core controls stretched the scorecard from 349.258/376.097 seconds to 553.087/531.102 seconds. preferred_inner_jobs=2 reserves the measured two-core width for each audit's internal Cargo and helper work, while jobs_env=CARGO_BUILD_JOBS carries a smaller admitted width into every child. The ordinary and quick/super variants set HERMIT_VALIDATE_AUDIT_JOBS=1 so their top-level audits run serially inside the shared aggregate budget (seven when measured; six since slice S13 of https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3301 retired the tests/backend-parity/split_asymmetric_pr.py self-test): the exact concurrent scheduler path consumed 601.132 CPU seconds and was killed by the unchanged 600-second cap, while isolated scorecard and pressure controls consumed 327.344 and 70.699 CPU seconds. The separately bounded hosted-privileged variant retains its prior two-worker schedule. jobs_flag is explicitly empty so dagrun does not also append its default -j argument to test-harness. Commands, audit population, wall/CPU caps, and scorecard deadlines are unchanged. CPU BOUND 2026-09-28: the ordinary and quick/super gates now carry 900 CPU seconds; the hosted-privileged variant keeps 600 with its 180-second wall. The audit work did not grow. At Hermit 81ca8822, b280bc48 and 1bd45c15 each audit's waited user+sys CPU agreed within 1% (scorecard 254.6-256.6, pressure 62.5-63.0, validate.rs 28.4-28.8 seconds), and across the 46 retained local validation profiles of this step from 2026-09-22 to 2026-09-28 user CPU stayed at or below 316.2 seconds while system CPU ranged from 32 to 374 seconds. The variable part is process creation. One complete gate at 81ca8822 runs 4011 git commands (scorecard 3182, validate.rs 509, pressure 204, DBT budget 65), and the local validation host resolves git to a telemetry wrapper that measured 51-85 ms of CPU per call against 5.1-5.2 ms for the git it wraps, spawning five further git processes and a detached logger for each call. On an unthrottled host the complete gate consumed 512.0 (b280bc48) and 535.7 (1bd45c15) CPU seconds with that wrapper first on PATH, and 305.5 and 300.7 with the wrapped git first. Three consecutive local runs on 2026-09-28 reached the old 600-second cap inside audits 5-7 with 340-374 seconds of system CPU. The largest observed user CPU, 316.2 seconds, times one plus the largest observed system/user ratio, 1.655, is 839.5 CPU seconds; 900 leaves 60.5 seconds above that product. It remains a runaway bound: a two-core spin is killed after 450 seconds, half of the unchanged 900-second wall."########;

The brackets create no scratch Git repository, run none of the scorecard's own commands and read no ledger; they read only this checkout's commits and the checked-in fixture under ci/compat-envelope/testdata/series-snapshot, with 57 git commands per run (the undivided self-test ran 3182). The brackets that do build scratch repositories (the command-line, retained-history and series-worktree brackets) run in selftest.scorecard_commands. This node is a leaf: a failure makes the validation red and no node depends on it. It keeps the gate's admitted two-core width (preferred_inner_jobs=2 carried through CARGO_BUILD_JOBS, no appended -j). NO CARGO: the tracked-output check derives the manifest-plan rows with the `hermit-manifest-plan` binary that setup.manifest_plan built beside test-harness; test-harness passes it through HERMIT_MANIFEST_PLAN_BIN (ToolSelfTest.manifest_plan_helper), and the hosted checks job unpacks both from one tarball. So this node runs no Cargo command: with a `cargo` first on PATH that fails when called and an empty CARGO_TARGET_DIR, it passed three times and `cargo` was never called. Before this it ran `cargo build -p hermit-manifest-plan`. The hosted tarball carries no Cargo fingerprints, so that build was cold there: 48.30 s wall and 89.53 CPU seconds at two jobs and load average 93, six times this node's CPU cap. Locally it waited on Cargo's target/debug lock while a concurrent debug build held it (in the full local validation of Hermit 84da7b816939, build.workspace held it from 379.0 to 997.9 seconds after the start, and the undivided selftest.scorecard started at 383.0 seconds). If the helper beside test-harness is missing, test-harness fails the node instead of building one. The Cargo-built path is still exercised by selftest.scorecard_commands and by the scorecard.compatibility nodes. Measured 2026-09-29 on the development host recorded in docs/TESTING_ENVIRONMENTS.md, "Named measurement hosts": in a small clone of Hermit dc395f8ae295 the node's command took about 2.8 CPU seconds (2.79-3.00 over three runs at load average 59 with the host's telemetry git wrapper first on PATH, 2.01-2.23 with the unwrapped git). In a retained validation checkout of the same commit, a worktree of the shared development clone, it took 4.19-4.91 CPU seconds over three runs at load average 65 with GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH set, the guard the object-store-independence bracket now puts on its absent-commit probe, and 4.96-6.58 CPU seconds without it. That clone had an 8,531-line configuration and 24,818 refs, which nearly doubled the CPU of each of the node's 62 wrapped git calls (47 against 25 ms), and a promisor remote, which made the unguarded probe for the deliberately absent commit 5ca1ab1e0000000000000000000000000000dead fetch four times before failing: about 1 CPU second, and 13.31 s wall in one run. In two full local validations of dc395f8ae295 beside release builds at load average 50-200, before the guard, the node recorded 7.19 CPU seconds in one and 15.65 in the other, which exceeded the cap: the CPU varies with host load as well as the wall. Earlier samples with the telemetry git wrapper first on PATH: `self-test` alone took 1.95-6.90 s wall and 1.95-3.82 CPU seconds over sixteen runs at load average 57-163, and 8.40 and 13.32 s wall with 2.59 and 2.74 CPU seconds while a workspace `cargo doc` ran beside it. Before the split the undivided command took 1183.84 s wall and 914.53 CPU seconds at load average 215-233. CAPS: 15 CPU seconds is 1.5 times the 10-second goal of https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3381, and 3.1 times the largest validation-checkout sample with the guard (4.91 s); the telemetry git wrapper's system CPU varies with host state (the gate recorded 32 to 374 system seconds for unchanged work, 2026-09-22 to 2026-09-28). The wall cap is 120 seconds: up to 30 seconds waiting for the scorecard write lock, which the check takes, plus 90 seconds, 6.8 times the largest wall sample (13.32 s), because the wall of the same work varied 6.8-fold with host load.

It needs the pinned ledger corpus through DEV_HERMIT_TEST_LEDGER_ROOT. WHEN IT RUNS: test-harness decides before starting it (ci/manifest-plan/src/self_test_selection.rs). It runs when any path changed since the merge base with origin/main, committed or not, is under one of its known inputs (SCORECARD_INPUTS in ci/manifest-plan/src/validation_dag.rs: the directories ci/compat-envelope/, ci/manifest-plan/, detcore-model/, ci/rust-script-bin/ and tests/e2e/manifests/, and the paths agent-utils (a submodule, whose commit moving counts), .gitmodules, Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, rust-toolchain.toml, scripts/lib/rust_script_prelude.rs, ci/prepare-rust-scripts.sh, ci/prepare-scorecard-self-test-corpus.sh and ci/expected-e2e-plan.json; a deleted or renamed path counts under its old and its new name); it always runs when HEAD is contained in main (refs/heads/main or any refs/remotes/*/main); it also runs when the change set cannot be resolved (a shallow clone, no origin/main, an empty change set, any git failure) and when HERMIT_SELFTEST_SELECTION=all. Otherwise it prints one line containing "NOT RUN by file selection:" that names the merge base and the changed paths, and passes; that line is the node's summary.

Earlier the same brackets, inside the undivided self-test, took 1183.84 s wall and 914.53 CPU seconds at load average 215-233 with the telemetry git wrapper first on PATH; that is the largest sample, and the 1800-second wall and 1500 CPU seconds are 1.52 and 1.64 times it. The cost is process creation (system CPU) for the scratch repositories' git commands; removing those repositories is the remaining step recorded in https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3381. It does not take the prepared helper that selftest.scorecard uses: it refuses HERMIT_MANIFEST_PLAN_BIN, because its command-line brackets check the helper that Cargo builds in the shared target directory. KNOWN WALL RISK, NOT MEASURED: it runs `cargo build` and `cargo run -p hermit-manifest-plan` against the checkout's target directory, and forces CARGO_TARGET_DIR=<checkout>/target for its result commands, so it waits on Cargo's build-directory lock while a concurrent product build holds it. In the full local validation of Hermit 84da7b816939, build.workspace held that directory for 618.8 seconds (379.0 to 997.9 s after the start); that window plus the 480.80-second sample is 1099.6 seconds, inside the 1800-second wall.

The two lists are joined by hand and nothing compared them: cargo cannot, because the client is C and the link happens when DynamoRIO loads it. MEASURED 2026-08-20: test.dbt_parity had been red nine days on one missing symbol, and advancing the Reverie pin took the gap from one to five while every build stayed green. This node compares the two dynamic symbol tables and names the missing callbacks, which DynamoRIO's own '<ERROR: using undefined symbol!>' never does. test.dbt_parity was retired in slice S13 of https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3301 and its 28 cases became DBT verify cells of the c-programs and system-utils manifests, so e2e.manifest_c_programs, e2e.manifest_system_utils and privileged-e2e.manifest_c_programs depend on this node. THOSE DEPENDENCIES ARE AN ORDERING FIX, NOT A DATA DEPENDENCY: nothing this node produces is consumed; the check runs first so a missing callback is named before eager-exit can cancel it. The cost is that a failure here skips those nodes' cells on every backend for that run, which is already red with the cause named. The e2e _on_host twins do not depend on it: the hosted-portable workflow runs each of them as its own job through ci/run-node.sh, which omits dependencies outside the job's selection, while this node runs in the separate dbt-runtime-abi release-shard job, which an E2E failure cannot cancel; ci/check-shard-coverage.sh therefore refuses an E2E edge to a node that no earlier hosted job supplies.

Its only caller was .github/workflows/ci-portable.yml, which builds the hosted matrix from the shard map, and hosted CI has not run since 2026-08-11 -- so the guard reported to nobody while TWO nodes drifted out of the map behind it: check.dbt_runtime_abi, corrected per-node on 2026-08-21 by 3b6cd503cc, and check.exit_status_class, corrected in this change. A guard whose only scheduler is dormant is indistinguishable from no guard, which is why this node runs it in the lane that actually executes: scripts/validate.rs selects the portable label from validate.json directly, so a node listed here runs on every local validate.

The rename arrives through a SUBMODULE PIN BUMP, so no hermit build target fails when a hermit-side reference goes stale -- which is exactly how main broke at 4b9a56bfc2: cargo build, test and clippy all stayed green while ci/run-dag.sh and ci/run-node.sh could not locate the runner at all and NO DAG NODE COULD EXECUTE. This node holds the retired spellings at zero in forward-looking files, and separately asserts that the Python and Rust JOBS_ENV_ENV constants match each other and Hermit's export. That second check is not decoration: it is how a node's declared build width reaches Cargo, and if any of the three names diverge, one or both engines silently fall back to the ambient 8 -- the width fix would revert itself in silence.

That is a host capability in the same sense as /dev/kvm, and this node is labelled `full` ONLY because local `scripts/validate.rs full` is the one lane whose checkouts sit under the parent: the hosted-portable and portable lanes check out bare Hermit on GitHub runners, and the privileged, hosted-privileged and super lanes use actions/checkout into the runner workspace. Until 2026-09-29 the arm ran inside check.lint_checks, which is also labelled hosted-portable, so every hosted run of that node could only report NO RESULT (exit 75) for it and the hosted workflow was red with every checker passing: https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/actions/runs/36550265580 and https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/actions/runs/36532203200. `make lint-checks` now runs the stop-path file with --exclude-canonical-adapter-accept-arm and prints that the arm is NOT COVERED by that run and that this node covers it; that exclude mode fails unless this node exists, is the only command that runs the arm, carries exactly the `full` label, and invokes the script directly. The command is a direct python3 invocation, not a make recipe, because make collapses a recipe's exit 75 into its own error and would turn a missing parent into a failure. Outcomes: 0 when the real adapter accepted one production-shaped schema-5 write into its stop-test spool and left the retired raw shadow and the published ledger untouched; 75 (no_result, with a NO-RESULT-CASE line) when no parent adapter is on any ancestor directory; any other nonzero is a failure.

Either way the selected bytes are installed at target/ci/hermit, the ONE path every direct consumer names (compatibility cells, test.cli, test.liteinst_strict, test.sabre_examples, test.envelope_levels), with libdetcore_sabre.so copied beside it and hashed before and after the copy; resources resolve through target/install_pkg. The same bytes are then published as a unique content-addressed directory plus pointer: the publisher hashes the binary before and after copying, snapshots target/install_pkg with symlinks dereferenced, verifies the required DBT/SaBRe/LiteInst/e9patch resources and the complete resource hash manifest, and atomically updates the pointer that the E2E manifest runs and ci/run-with-hermit-e2e-artifact.sh consumers read. The validate ledger records the choice as release_builder and e2e_payload, and a Buck row is neither a Cargo cache hit nor a receipt. Cargo does not hash-suffix binary outputs, so each preparation selection that links the Hermit bin relinks target/validate/hermit; the preparation record hashes it after the last selection, and this node publishes exactly those bytes instead of rebuilding (a rebuild here recompiled Hermit and hit the 120-second cap in the first one-build validation, and would have diverged from the recorded runtime file).

Validation run validate-coord-s15-fdd8f55a8e7c (Hermit fdd8f55a8e7c, 2026-09-28) measured the two nodes at 128.62 s and 75.76 s of wall time (about 204 s together), 844 s and 510 s of CPU time (1354 s together, under the unchanged 7200 s CPU bound), and peaks of 3862880256 and 3859349504 bytes at width 8. The wall bound rises from 600 s to 900 s and the estimate from 300 s to 480 s, the sum of the two former estimates; memory bounds are unchanged because peak memory follows the worker width, which stays 8, not the number of cells. The selector no longer passes --allow-empty: a c-programs node that selects no cells now fails instead of passing having run nothing. WORKER WIDTH measured 2026-08-23: recent 20-way validation runs rotated an identical empty early-Run1 no_result across unrelated ptrace cells, while each affected cell passed in another run. A focused run at eight workers completed all 127 selected strict rows in 264.3s with 127 canonical matches and no no_result, leaving a measured 335.7s margin to the unchanged 600s hang bound. This node reserves all 8 manifest_guest slots and passes the same width to the harness; ordinary Hermit gates may overlap now that their unsupported exclusive resource is removed. Tradeoff: blocking validation still does not exercise the former 20-way manifest pressure; every cell and the strict comparator remain enabled and unchanged. MEMORY measured 2026-08-25 at Hermit 16f70d9994 with the complete current-main artifact and width 8 under ambient load 40-107: five uncapped cgroup peaks were 2855145472-2894295040 bytes; three stricter 4-GiB-cap repetitions completed all 128 cells with peaks up to 3025047552 bytes and no cgroup kill. The 4-GiB baseline rounds above the observed high-water mark; the 6-GiB hard cap preserves nearly 3 GiB of runaway headroom without reserving the former unmeasured 32 GiB."########,

It runs the validation's one Hermit build, the e2e artifact build.host_hermit_link links on the host, against the fixtures rrcompatprep.fixtures writes. The old lane ran `record start --verify --verify-strict`; the harness adds what every manifest replay cell has: --strict, --log info, --base-env=minimal, and a tmpfs /test working directory. Only 51 of the 139 pass, on the old lane's own command too (measured on 97ae0ccef with its release Hermit), so the old lane could not have been green: the other 88 stop recording with exit status 122 because record mode refuses every clock read (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3519), and the corpus lists them as `unselected` under that issue, so the node gates the 51 and any of them that diverges, crashes or exceeds its budget turns it red.

It runs the validation's one Hermit build, the e2e artifact build.host_hermit_link links on the host, whose install tree carries the SaBRe loader and libdetcore_sabre.so, against the fixtures sabrecompatprep.fixtures writes; each cell runs Hermit's stripped --verify once and must also pass the harness's SaBRe execution-path contract (an RPC from the in-guest tool, zero ptrace-fallback and zero trusted shared-object system-call sites). A cell measured red stays enabled with `ci: false` and its failure class's issue (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3486 and the issues it names), so `--ci-only` selects only the cells that pass. The guest's own dynamic loader loads libdetcore_sabre.so against the guest's libc, so the artifact's publication and verification refuse a plugin that records a library search path, needs a library outside glibc, or requires a glibc symbol version newer than 2.34 (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3652). A program that diverges, crashes or leaves SaBRe's measured path turns it red. Until 2026-10-01 these rows were 212 separate sabrecompat.<program> nodes that checked only Hermit's exit status, so a program whose children ran outside SaBRe passed, and on a fresh checkout their release Hermit had no SaBRe loader at all. The node's 2120-second wall bound is the 1820 seconds `scripts/validate.rs --self-test` requires of it as outer headroom, plus 300 seconds for the rest of the bucket, so a hung heavy cell is reported as that cell's timeout rather than ending the node. The self-test models every manifest cell as two attempts with 10 seconds of termination grace each, and its representative 1.5x wall multiplier turns the largest selected cells (rustc and node on ptrace, 600 seconds each) into 900-second windows: 2 x (900 + 10).

MEMORY RECALIBRATED 2026-08-25 (task remeasure_the_fourteen_stale): five current exact-command cgroup samples peaked at 279248896 bytes after the feature widening; the larger width-8 historical calibration of 4.0 GiB governs. The 4-GiB baseline preserves that floor and the 6-GiB hard cap adds 2 GiB of headroom. CPU WIDTH remains pinned at 8 by CARGO_BUILD_JOBS and preferred_inner_jobs; jobs_flag stays empty because appending '-j 8' would reach rustc. See ai_docs/dag-memory-caps-recalibration-20260825.md.

CPU-WIDTH DERIVATION 2026-08-10 (task p0_dynamorio_build_cache): preferred_inner_jobs=8 is delivered through the CARGO_BUILD_JOBS jobs_env channel. See doc.rustdoc for the shared derivation; jobs_flag is empty so the declaration sizes the cgroup box only and never edits argv. PROFILE 2026-09-30: stays in Cargo's dev profile, like lint.clippy and doc.rustdoc. In the first one-build validation that ran it with --profile validate, the doctest build after the nextest preparation was not fresh: it recompiled reverie-dbt, hermit-install (whose build script restages target/install_pkg), detcore-dbt and hermit in target/validate while prepared test nodes ran, and six of them refused with 'prepared executable, package identity, or runtime file changed'. In the dev profile hermit-install's build script exits immediately and nothing under target/validate is written. MEM-CAP RE-DERIVATION 2026-09-30: the 2-GiB cap above was derived on a WARM host target that a debug workspace build had filled. In the pinned root no node builds dev-profile libraries first (clippy and rustdoc produce metadata only), so this node compiles the workspace libraries cold; with the 2-GiB cap it was OOM-killed after 23 s (4 oom_kill events) in the validation of hermit 63a043595. The cold dev-profile clippy at the same CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8 completes under its 6-GiB cap, so rss_baseline is 4 GiB and hard_mem_max_bytes 8 GiB until a cold cgroup-recorded peak is measured."########,

The previous figure PREDATED the --all-features/-D warnings change and I flagged it stale when I made that change; this replaces it rather than leaving the caveat standing. method=cgroup-RECORDED (systemd-run --user -p MemoryAccounting=yes, MemoryPeak == cgroup memory.peak), pinned_jobs=8 via the CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8 prefix, target_state=warm with `rm -rf target/doc` first so rustdoc actually reruns. n=2 complete runs, both result=success: 1505439744 and 1491546112 bytes (1.402 and 1.389 GiB); the larger is recorded. A THIRD, COLDER, INCOMPLETE run peaked HIGHER at 1913589760 (1.78 GiB) before it was killed, so a cold-cache run costs more than this warm figure and 1.78 GiB is a lower bound for that case -- the existing 3 GiB hard cap still clears it, which is why hard_mem_max_bytes is UNCHANGED. ⚠️ est_duration_s DELIBERATELY NOT UPDATED. Warm wall clock here was 12s against the recorded 150, but this box reports 316 effective CPUs (see the run-with-reverie-dbt-budget.sh banner), so its wall clock is not transferable to a CI runner. CPU time consumed was 33.4s, which is the portable number if anyone wants to re-derive duration properly. Memory peak transfers; wall clock on a 316-CPU host does not. ENFORCEMENT 2026-08-25 (task doc_rustdoc_cannot_fail): RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings added. Until now this node ran cargo doc with no RUSTDOCFLAGS, so it EXITED 0 WHILE EMITTING WARNINGS -- it rendered documentation and could not fail on documentation defects. Measured against the real pre-fix source at 89288ed6ad^: the old command exits 0 with 3 warnings; with -D warnings it exits 101 and names both offending items and lines. --all-features added alongside, and HONESTLY IT IS PRECAUTIONARY RATHER THAN A FIX: measured today it changes nothing for rustdoc -- 13 crates and 920 HTML pages either way, zero delta -- because the feature-gated items in hermit-cli are #[doc(hidden)] re-exports and detcore-dbt is a workspace member documented regardless. It is here so that a DOCUMENTED item placed behind a feature gate later cannot become invisible, which is the mechanism that hid clippy findings until e602aaa991. Do not read it as closing a live gap. .github/workflows/docs.yml deliberately NOT changed: it PUBLISHES to gh-pages rather than gating, and a publisher that refuses to publish over a doc warning is a worse trade. MEM/CPU DERIVATION 2026-08-10 (tasks memory-caps-must-scale-with-job-count, fix_doc_rustdoc_dynamorio and p0_dynamorio_build_cache): pinned_jobs=8 via both CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8 and preferred_inner_jobs=8. THIS NODE CARRIES THE SHARED DERIVATION for every step whose preferred width is delivered through the CARGO_BUILD_JOBS jobs_env channel; target/debug/test-harness enforces the pairing as a rule over all such steps. The explicit preferred width is load-bearing: safe-ci's declarations-first default (agent-utils DEFAULT_SMALL_CPU_COUNT=1) otherwise boxes this eight-worker cold DynamoRIO build to cpu.max=1 core while the DBT ratchet derives 132s from eight effective workers. ROOT CAUSE, measured: hermit ab4a8c08 advanced the agent-utils gitlink a6f4232 ('make the SMALL default cap OPT-IN, default OFF') -> 1d893fbc, which contains ada564d ('activate small undeclared-step caps'); every head that failed pins the activated runner and both heads that passed pin a6f4232. LIVE CGROUP READ with the runner built at the pinned SHA, each step reporting its own /proc/self/cgroup -> cpu.max: an undeclared step gets '100000 100000' (1 core) and a preferred_inner_jobs=8 step gets '800000 100000' (8 cores). A/B ON THE IDENTICAL DynamoRIO cmake build --parallel 8 (316-core validation host, load avg 46): unboxed 15.37s wall / 102.51 CPU-s at 666% CPU, versus CPUQuota=100% 112.23s wall / 112.01 CPU-s at 99% CPU; cmake configure is a further 3.65s serial. 112s at one core is already 85% of the 132s budget for the build alone, and sharing that core with the node's concurrent rustdoc/cargo work produced the observed 185.51/187.79/188.06/286.70s. CONTROL: build.workspace and build.runtime_release were the only steps that already declared a width (32) and were the only cpu-bound steps that did not regress (91s -> 88s), while undeclared test.detcore_unit went 34s -> 103s. The 132s ratchet is UNCHANGED and stays fully live: 15.4s observed against 132s once eight cores are actually delivered. jobs_flag is empty so the declaration sizes the cgroup box only; CARGO_BUILD_JOBS already conveys the width to Cargo, and appending '-j 8' would edit argv (harmless here, but it would reach libtest or rustc on three sibling steps). rss_baseline=measured_peak@j8=1.1GiB; method=cgroup-RECORDED (systemd MemoryPeak == cgroup memory.peak, NOT sampled); target_state=warm Rust artifacts but a distinct cargo-doc reverie-dbt build-script OUT_DIR can still cold-build DynamoRIO; hermit@21b22c2b. headroom=+1.9GiB additive -> hard_mem_max_bytes=3.0GiB.

The 5-GiB scheduling baseline rounds above that floor and the 7-GiB hard cap adds 2 GiB of headroom. CPU WIDTH remains pinned at 8 for the build phase while nextest execution remains -j1. See ai_docs/dag-memory-caps-recalibration-20260825.md. TEST CONCURRENCY -j1 EXPLAINED 2026-08-26 (task goal-5-build-the-validate-parallel-scaling-model-1-to-316-threads): the -j1 is DELIBERATE, not a default. It preserves a --test-threads=1 introduced 2026-07-27 in 6044c2d39a and carried to nextest -j1 on 2026-08-10 in 3dc3a08a79, whose message says 'Preserve serial execution where Hermit tests require it'. The sibling test.detcore_unit (-p hermit-detcore --lib --bins) has never carried it, so the choice is selective. Hermit's INTEGRATION tests get the same serialization by a different route -- .config/nextest.toml caps the test-group hermit-serialized at max-threads 1 over filter package(=hermit) & kind(=test); --lib and --bins are NOT kind(=test), which is why this node needs the flag instead. That file states the reason at lines 30-32: the hermit test binaries 'use process-local mutexes to serialize Hermit executions', and several tests here do execute Hermit (for example run::detects_symlink_resolution_through_implicit_mounts and the verify::tests::* family). MEASURED COST OF THE PIN: 1.93x. Two replicates each at a6b0c37648df on the host recorded for this measurement in docs/TESTING_ENVIRONMENTS.md under Named measurement hosts, -j1 gave 27.0s and 27.3s against -j16 at 14.4s and 13.7s. WARNING FOR WHOEVER MEASURES THIS NEXT -- TWO DISTINCT KNOBS, DO NOT PUT THEM ON ONE AXIS. CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8 bounds BUILD width; nextest -j bounds TEST concurrency. The 1.93x is attributable to -j alone; the wrapper's build width was unchanged throughout. Plotting a build width and a test concurrency on one axis produces a smooth curve that means nothing. Those figures are WARM-REPEAT times, not node times: this node takes 57.6s in a full validate. The SPEEDUP transfers, the absolute seconds do not. NOT ESTABLISHED: whether the serialization is still necessary. No commit or comment names which lib/bin test requires it. Two -j16 runs returned rc=0 and that is NOT evidence of safety, because a race that only appears under concurrency is exactly what two green runs cannot rule out. Raising this needs someone to confirm Hermit's lib and bin targets are free of the process-local mutex constraint; until then the 1.93x is not claimable. KVM EXECUTION TEST SKIPPED HERE 2026-09-30: the full profile's unified Nextest build compiles the hermit library tests with kvm-execution-tests, which adds kvm_execution_tests::initialized_vm_setup_failures_consume_detcore_state_without_further_guest_execution to this binary; --skip kvm_execution_tests:: keeps this node's population exactly what it ran before, and privileged-test.cli_kvm still runs that test and requires it by name."########,

The hint keeps the whole-target budget measured 2026-09-29 at hermit 905903e0a7ed, which bounds this subset from above: five serial runs of all 28 then-existing cases, each in its own systemd-run --user --scope unit, peaked at 111661056-115081216 bytes of cgroup memory.peak and took 5.32-6.12 s of wall time, and a sixth used 7.12 CPU-seconds. The 256-MiB scheduling baseline is the next power of two at or above the 115081216-byte maximum plus 20%, the 1-GiB hard cap supplies headroom, and est_duration_s rounds the maximum wall time up to 7 seconds."########,

The final command prebuilds the exact cli and hermit_modes integration binaries consumed by the privileged test nodes, so their wall budgets measure test execution instead of Cargo compilation or target-lock waiting. After the bin build, the content-addressed publisher verifies source type/mode/size, hashes before and after copying, verifies the published hash and atomically updates the pointer before any later Cargo invocation can relink target/debug/hermit.

        description: r########"FOLD 2026-09-28 (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3301): the backend-parity-c bucket was folded into c-programs, so this node now also runs the 276 portable cells that e2e.manifest_backend_parity_c ran (713 portable cells in all), and that node is gone. Validation run validate-coord-s15-fdd8f55a8e7c (Hermit fdd8f55a8e7c, 2026-09-28) measured the two nodes at 128.62 s and 75.76 s of wall time (about 204 s together), 844 s and 510 s of CPU time (1354 s together, under the unchanged 7200 s CPU bound), and peaks of 3862880256 and 3859349504 bytes at width 8. The wall bound rises from 600 s to 900 s and the estimate from 300 s to 480 s, the sum of the two former estimates; memory bounds are unchanged because peak memory follows the worker width, which stays 8, not the number of cells. The selector no longer passes --allow-empty: a c-programs node that selects no cells now fails instead of passing having run nothing. WORKER WIDTH measured 2026-08-23: recent 20-way validation runs rotated an identical empty early-Run1 no_result across unrelated ptrace cells, while each affected cell passed in another run. A focused run at eight workers completed all 127 selected strict rows in 264.3s with 127 canonical matches and no no_result, leaving a measured 335.7s margin to the unchanged 600s hang bound. This node reserves all 8 manifest_guest slots and passes the same width to the harness; ordinary Hermit gates may overlap now that their unsupported exclusive resource is removed. Tradeoff: blocking validation still does not exercise the former 20-way manifest pressure; every cell and the strict comparator remain enabled and unchanged. MEMORY measured 2026-08-25 at Hermit 16f70d9994 with the complete current-main artifact and width 8 under ambient load 40-107: five uncapped cgroup peaks were 2855145472-2894295040 bytes; three stricter 4-GiB-cap repetitions completed all 128 cells with peaks up to 3025047552 bytes and no cgroup kill. The 4-GiB baseline rounds above the observed high-water mark; the 6-GiB hard cap preserves nearly 3 GiB of runaway headroom without reserving the former unmeasured 32 GiB."########,

The final command prebuilds the exact cli and hermit_modes integration binaries consumed by the privileged test nodes, so their wall budgets measure test execution instead of Cargo compilation or target-lock waiting. After the bin build, the content-addressed publisher verifies source type/mode/size, hashes before and after copying, verifies the published hash and atomically updates the pointer before any later Cargo invocation can relink target/debug/hermit. This privileged lane deliberately publishes a binary-only artifact; unlike portable DBT/SaBRe/LiteInst cells, it does not consume install_pkg resources.

Its guest reads one live leaf under each of eight host sysfs prefixes (block, hwmon, rtc, node, btrfs, irq, uevent, module) and refuses when a prefix has no readable leaf, so it needs a host that has that hardware and a mounted btrfs. GitHub-hosted run https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/actions/runs/36485831200 failed it with "hwmon has no readable sanitized leaf". The manifest entry is therefore lane: privileged, which keeps it out of the hosted-portable selection while the full profile still runs it. Wall evidence from the ledger series of the development host recorded in docs/TESTING_ENVIRONMENTS.md, "Named measurement hosts" (2026-08..09): verify/ptrace 148 samples, per-run median 2096 ms, max 15438 ms; verify/kvm 29 samples, median 2316 ms, max 3467 ms. Memory hints match the portable system-utils bucket, whose 3 GiB hard cap already contained both cells at --jobs 1. The shared 600 s E2E-class node bound is the backstop."########,
