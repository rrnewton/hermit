const RUST_SCRIPT_PRODUCER_DESCRIPTION: &str = r########"DISCOVERED PRODUCER 2026-08-31: every tracked rust-script entrypoint is generated as a Cargo package, checked with the existing clippy policy, built as a release executable, and, when it carries tests, built as a test harness. The outputs are copied into target/ci/rust-scripts after checkout and pin verification, and all compiling consumers wait for this node. Repository graph commands resolve rust-script through ci/rust-script-bin, which executes only the published binaries and never invokes Cargo; sources owned by external operational tooling remain that tooling's responsibility. Two concurrent rust-script --force probes sharing one cache measured a real Cargo build-directory lock wait; separate caches removed the wait but duplicated compilation. Keeping one writer and read-only consumers makes compilation placement deterministic without creating per-node target directories. RESOURCE BOUNDS measured 2026-09-14 at Hermit 7b8be60708c29b4926f36f06be8793523841d6ba: the old 2-GiB hard cap killed the cold width-8 producer in run 1812 and in a focused width-4 control. With the unchanged 28-entrypoint/17-harness workload and width 8, three ordinary cold runs with memory.max=6442450944 bytes passed with cgroup peaks 3836551168, 3845783552, and 3841757184 bytes; three pinned-root cold runs under that same memory.max passed with peaks 3803856896, 3721408512, and 3691466752 bytes. All six recorded memory.events max=0, oom=0, and oom_kill=0. The 4-GiB baseline rounds above the measured high-water mark for scheduler accounting; the 6-GiB hard cap adds more than 2.4 GiB of runaway headroom while fitting the project's 8-GiB minimum runner. preferred_inner_jobs=8 remains paired with CARGO_BUILD_JOBS so the scheduler reserves the same eight-CPU width Cargo actually uses. WALL BOUND 2026-10-04: the producer's wall bound was 900 seconds, the width-8 wall equivalent of its unchanged 7200-second CPU bound. Across 22 local full validations of Hermit main between 2026-10-01 and 2026-10-04 the ordinary producer's wall peaked at 644.496 seconds (median 201.548), and the pinned-root producer's at 527.414 seconds. The peak run, at Hermit 972dd0ead8c440da3716e7c3ccf47f5eac34cc6e, used 1253.8 CPU seconds, 14% above the 1097.5-second median, over 3.2 times the median wall, so it reflects fewer available cores rather than more work. 900 seconds was 1.40 times that peak, below the project's rule that a limit be at least 1.5 times the largest observed use, so the wall bound is now 1200 seconds, the next 300-second bucket above 1.5 times 644.496 seconds (966.7). The ordinary, pinned-root, hosted-privileged on-host and quick/super producers share this constant. Quick and super use a distinct 1200-second CPU budget and zero duration estimate: 1200 is the next project 300-second bucket above 1.5 times the largest measured 737.730-second CPU sample. The Step constructor orders these as wall, CPU, then memory."########;

GitHub's hosted portable job runs this node on whatever hardware the runner pool assigns, and its scheduler caps the node to the run's three-CPU budget (logged as "exceeds the run total CPU-core budget --max-cpus 3; capping its guest width and per-step cpu.max to 3"). In https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/actions/runs/37383177918 (Hermit f43c990b3c96, AMD EPYC 9V45) the node passed in 752.75 seconds: Cargo reported 73 seconds for detcore-dbt and 643 for the workspace (37 crates compiled after a partial cache restore), and the rest, chiefly preparation, took about 37. In https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/actions/runs/37440093209 (Hermit 47896b1a15dd, AMD EPYC 7763) the same phases took 120 and 1048 seconds (33 crates compiled), 1.6 times longer each, and the node was killed at 1200.07 seconds, 20 seconds into the dev-profile nextest-cpu-wrapper build that took 18 seconds on the faster host; at the same ratio it needed about 1240. The two runs built different Hermit revisions, so this is not an isolated comparison; but the slower run compiled fewer crates and both Cargo phases slowed by the same factor, which points to the runner rather than the build. 2100 is the next 300-second bucket above 1.5 times both the killed run's lower bound of 1200 seconds (1800.1) and the 1240-second estimate (1860). Under the three-CPU cpu.max cap, 2100 seconds of wall allow at most 6300 CPU seconds, inside the unchanged 7200-second CPU bound. The host pressure graph (ci/compat-envelope/pressure-test.rs) clones this node as its build.workspace and so carries the same wall."########;

GitHub's hosted portable job runs this node beside check.lint_checks and the selftest.* nodes, and its scheduler caps the node's width (HERMIT_SCRIPT_TEST_JOBS) at the run's three-CPU budget (--max-cpus 3). That run is unboxed: no cgroup holds the node to three CPUs, and its log reports that the node's CPU bound cannot be enforced there, so only the wall applies. In https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/actions/runs/37543769782 (Hermit d7441caea790) the node was killed at 900.16 seconds. Its other units had finished by 615 seconds; the one test still running was the scripts/validate.rs submodule service-result fixture, started at about 630 seconds, whose child compiles a copied validate.rs with rust-script under its own 300-second bound. That child had run 266.96 seconds and had been compiling its last crate, the validate binary (28.6 seconds locally at three CPUs), for 11.83 seconds, so it would have reached its own bound first and no node wall would have let that revision pass. On the host recorded for this node in docs/TESTING_ENVIRONMENTS.md ("Named measurement hosts"), a run of this node at three CPUs with a cold rust-script cache took 724.57 seconds, and the hosted run reached the same milestones 1.5 to 2.6 times later. The fixture child now compiles at Cargo opt-level 0: a cold three-CPU build of its package fell from 147.71 to 50.85 seconds, and the fixture alone at four CPUs from 146.19 to 84.17. Scaling the hosted child's compile by that ratio and taking 2.6 times the fixture's local non-compile time (about 34 seconds) gives an estimate of about 850 seconds for the hosted node; that is not a hosted measurement, and 900 seconds would leave less than the project's 50% headroom over it. 1500 is the next 300-second bucket above 1.5 times both the measured lower bound of 900.16 seconds (1350.2) and the 850-second estimate (1275). At a width of three, 1500 seconds of wall come to about 4500 CPU seconds, inside the unchanged 7200-second CPU bound wherever a run can enforce it."########;

const MANIFEST_GATE_DESCRIPTION: &str = r########"SELF-TESTS MOVED OUT 2026-09-29: every product node waits on this gate, and the local validation of Hermit 98a621f42935d585e1306262b11d64488dd51614 was killed here by the 900-second CPU cap while the gate was still running repository-tool self-tests. Those self-tests (scorecard, pressure_test, validate_rs, manifest_cli, dbt_budget; TOOL_SELF_TESTS in validation_dag.rs) now run as selftest.<name> leaf nodes that still decide the verdict but block nothing. The gate keeps only what product nodes consume: the manifest-plan audits run in process (DAG/manifest correspondence, budget ordering, determinism-stress evidence, CLI brackets and the expected-cell plan, which define the cells and commands the product nodes execute), and `generate-test-footprints --check`, which proves the committed ci/test-footprints.json still matches ci/dag/validate.json and Cargo metadata, so hosted test selection picks product nodes from current data. Measured 2026-09-29 on the measurement host recorded for gate.manifest in docs/TESTING_ENVIRONMENTS.md ("Named measurement hosts") at load average 215-233: `test-harness validate` took 2.88 s wall and 2.53 CPU seconds (1.99 user, 0.54 system, 29440 KiB largest process RSS), against 664 s of wall before it was killed at 900 CPU seconds with the self-tests included. The 120 CPU seconds are 47 times that sample and bound a hang, not the work; the ordinary and quick/super gates share the constant. The 900-second wall is unchanged because the committed portable preflight critical path is built from it (3780 seconds, then 3900 once setup.manifest_plan's wall cap went from 180 to 300 seconds). HERMIT_VALIDATE_AUDIT_JOBS=1 and the two-core width are retained; with one remaining child audit they no longer change the schedule. The history below describes the former seven-audit gate. AUDIT WIDTH CONTRACT 2026-09-25: RUN1902 admitted this gate to a one-core cgroup but inherited CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4 from the outer validation environment. test-harness treated that unrelated value as the admitted width, launched two heavyweight metadata audits, and the scorecard's unchanged five-second snapshot command control was starved and killed after producing no output. The retained step profile recorded 0.9264 effective cores and 380.573 seconds throttled. Cold isolated controls at Hermit 22e9e0b5 and ecb3c9a5 passed with the original five-second boundary; concurrent one-core controls stretched the scorecard from 349.258/376.097 seconds to 553.087/531.102 seconds. preferred_inner_jobs=2 reserves the measured two-core width for each audit's internal Cargo and helper work, while jobs_env=CARGO_BUILD_JOBS carries a smaller admitted width into every child. The ordinary and quick/super variants set HERMIT_VALIDATE_AUDIT_JOBS=1 so their top-level audits run serially inside the shared aggregate budget (seven when measured; six since slice S13 of https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3301 retired the tests/backend-parity/split_asymmetric_pr.py self-test): the exact concurrent scheduler path consumed 601.132 CPU seconds and was killed by the unchanged 600-second cap, while isolated scorecard and pressure controls consumed 327.344 and 70.699 CPU seconds. The separately bounded hosted-privileged variant retains its prior two-worker schedule. jobs_flag is explicitly empty so dagrun does not also append its default -j argument to test-harness. Commands, audit population, wall/CPU caps, and scorecard deadlines are unchanged. CPU BOUND 2026-09-28: the ordinary and quick/super gates now carry 900 CPU seconds; the hosted-privileged variant keeps 600 with its 180-second wall. The audit work did not grow. At Hermit 81ca8822, b280bc48 and 1bd45c15 each audit's waited user+sys CPU agreed within 1% (scorecard 254.6-256.6, pressure 62.5-63.0, validate.rs 28.4-28.8 seconds), and across the 46 retained local validation profiles of this step from 2026-09-22 to 2026-09-28 user CPU stayed at or below 316.2 seconds while system CPU ranged from 32 to 374 seconds. The variable part is process creation. One complete gate at 81ca8822 runs 4011 git commands (scorecard 3182, validate.rs 509, pressure 204, DBT budget 65), and the local validation host resolves git to a telemetry wrapper that measured 51-85 ms of CPU per call against 5.1-5.2 ms for the git it wraps, spawning five further git processes and a detached logger for each call. On an unthrottled host the complete gate consumed 512.0 (b280bc48) and 535.7 (1bd45c15) CPU seconds with that wrapper first on PATH, and 305.5 and 300.7 with the wrapped git first. Three consecutive local runs on 2026-09-28 reached the old 600-second cap inside audits 5-7 with 340-374 seconds of system CPU. The largest observed user CPU, 316.2 seconds, times one plus the largest observed system/user ratio, 1.655, is 839.5 CPU seconds; 900 leaves 60.5 seconds above that product. It remains a runaway bound: a two-core spin is killed after 450 seconds, half of the unchanged 900-second wall."########;

        description: r########"TOOL SELF-TEST NODE, REGRESSION TIER 2026-09-29 (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3381): runs `ci/compat-envelope/scorecard.rs self-test-and-check` through `test-harness selftest scorecard`, which is the scorecard's in-process brackets followed by the tracked-output check. The brackets create no scratch Git repository, run none of the scorecard's own commands and read no ledger; they read only this checkout's commits and the checked-in fixture under ci/compat-envelope/testdata/series-snapshot, with 57 git commands per run (the undivided self-test ran 3182). The brackets that do build scratch repositories (the command-line, retained-history and series-worktree brackets) run in selftest.scorecard_commands. This node is a leaf: a failure makes the validation red and no node depends on it. It keeps the gate's admitted two-core width (preferred_inner_jobs=2 carried through CARGO_BUILD_JOBS, no appended -j). NO CARGO: the tracked-output check derives the manifest-plan rows with the `hermit-manifest-plan` binary that setup.manifest_plan built beside test-harness; test-harness passes it through HERMIT_MANIFEST_PLAN_BIN (ToolSelfTest.manifest_plan_helper), and the hosted checks job unpacks both from one tarball. So this node runs no Cargo command: with a `cargo` first on PATH that fails when called and an empty CARGO_TARGET_DIR, it passed three times and `cargo` was never called. Before this it ran `cargo build -p hermit-manifest-plan`. The hosted tarball carries no Cargo fingerprints, so that build was cold there: 48.30 s wall and 89.53 CPU seconds at two jobs and load average 93, three times this node's 30-second CPU cap. Locally it waited on Cargo's target/debug lock while a concurrent debug build held it (in the full local validation of Hermit 84da7b816939, build.workspace held it from 379.0 to 997.9 seconds after the start, and the undivided selftest.scorecard started at 383.0 seconds). If the helper beside test-harness is missing, test-harness fails the node instead of building one. The Cargo-built path is still exercised by selftest.scorecard_commands and by the scorecard.compatibility nodes. Measured 2026-09-29 on the development host recorded in docs/TESTING_ENVIRONMENTS.md, "Named measurement hosts": in a small clone of Hermit dc395f8ae295 the node's command took about 2.8 CPU seconds (2.79-3.00 over three runs at load average 59 with the host's telemetry git wrapper first on PATH, 2.01-2.23 with the unwrapped git). In a retained validation checkout of the same commit, a worktree of the shared development clone, it took 4.19-4.91 CPU seconds over three runs at load average 65 with GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH set, the guard the object-store-independence bracket now puts on its absent-commit probe, and 4.96-6.58 CPU seconds without it. That clone had an 8,531-line configuration and 24,818 refs, which nearly doubled the CPU of each of the node's 62 wrapped git calls (47 against 25 ms), and a promisor remote, which made the unguarded probe for the deliberately absent commit 5ca1ab1e0000000000000000000000000000dead fetch four times before failing: about 1 CPU second, and 13.31 s wall in one run. In two full local validations of dc395f8ae295 beside release builds at load average 50-200, before the guard, the node recorded 7.19 CPU seconds in one and 15.65 in the other, which exceeded the 15-second cap then in place: the CPU varies with host load as well as the wall. Earlier samples with the telemetry git wrapper first on PATH: `self-test` alone took 1.95-6.90 s wall and 1.95-3.82 CPU seconds over sixteen runs at load average 57-163, and 8.40 and 13.32 s wall with 2.59 and 2.74 CPU seconds while a workspace `cargo doc` ran beside it. Before the split the undivided command took 1183.84 s wall and 914.53 CPU seconds at load average 215-233. SYSTEM CPU IN LOCAL VALIDATIONS, measured 2026-10-04 and 2026-10-05 UTC on the same host: 52 retained local validation runs from 2026-09-30 to 2026-10-05 UTC ran this node under a 15-CPU-second cap. Its user CPU stayed between 2.08 and 4.06 seconds while its system CPU ranged from 0.68 to 13.46 seconds. 48 runs passed at 2.87-10.37 CPU seconds. Three finished the work and were counted over the cap: 15.09, 15.24 and 15.65 CPU seconds at Hermit 8503b4fc, 66378ba1 and dc395f8a, of which 11.02, 12.89 and 12.57 seconds were system CPU. The fourth, at Hermit c1312a56, was stopped at 15.29 CPU seconds after the brackets had finished and before the tracked-output check had; the brackets are about 77 percent of the node's CPU (4.25-4.70 of 5.53-6.14 CPU seconds in three standalone runs), so that run would have taken at most about 20 CPU seconds. The extra system CPU is not work this node adds. Across the 52 runs its system CPU correlates 0.84-0.94 with the system CPU of the light checks that start within the same three seconds (check.dagrun_naming 0.94, e2e.audit_compile_c_programs 0.93, check.portability_paths and check.script_sigpipe 0.91, check.shard_coverage 0.89, selftest.dbt_budget 0.84), and with neither the host load average (0.18) nor host CPU, memory or I/O pressure (0.04-0.14). In the 66378ba1 run those checks and check.run_node_args spent 1.7 to 5.5 times their median system CPU (this node 5.2 times), while every one of them kept its user CPU within 1.21 times its median. That run already used the unwrapped git: the validation driver's git substitution was applied. A second full local validation of 66378ba1 40 minutes later, also with the unwrapped git and with identical node output, passed this node at 10.30 CPU seconds (2.47 user, 7.82 system) at load average 249-256, against 15.24 (2.35 user, 12.89 system) at load average 176-199 in the failing run; the six checks that started within three seconds before this node in both runs (check.dagrun_naming, e2e.audit_compile_c_programs, check.portability_paths, check.script_sigpipe, check.shard_coverage and check.run_node_args) each spent 1.44 to 1.75 times as much system CPU in the failing run as in the passing one (this node 1.65 times), with user CPU within 6 percent. Standalone at 66378ba1, three runs each at load average 172-190, counted by a cgroup as dagrun counts this node, the command took 2.18-2.90 CPU seconds with the unwrapped git and 5.25-9.15 with the telemetry git wrapper first on PATH; /usr/bin/time reported only 3.99-5.07 for the wrapped runs because it misses the wrapper's detached telemetry logger, which the cgroup charges. With selftest.scorecard_commands, selftest.pressure_test, selftest.validate_rs and scripts/run-script-tests.sh running beside it at load average 252-272, four completed runs took 2.93-4.52 CPU seconds; two more in that set failed after waiting 30 seconds for the scorecard write lock. The telemetry git wrapper's system CPU also varies with host state (the gate recorded 32 to 374 system seconds for unchanged work, 2026-09-22 to 2026-09-28).

The cap was 15, 1.5 times the 10-second goal of https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3381; that goal still describes this node's own work, the user CPU and the unwrapped standalone samples above, but not the system CPU that the validation's concurrent start adds to every node. The wall cap is 120 seconds: up to 30 seconds waiting for the scorecard write lock, which the check takes, plus 90 seconds, 6.8 times the largest standalone wall sample (13.32 s) and 3.7 times the largest validation wall above (24.43 s, at 66378ba1), because the wall of the same work varied 6.8-fold with host load.

        description: r########"TOOL SELF-TEST NODE, COMMANDS TIER 2026-09-29 (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3381): runs `ci/compat-envelope/scorecard.rs self-test-commands` through `test-harness selftest scorecard_commands`: the regression-tier brackets of selftest.scorecard again, then the brackets that run the scorecard's own commands against a scratch clone of this checkout, a scratch ledger repository and a scratch reverie repository (the command-line, retained-history and series-worktree brackets, including the empty-result command, the replacement-ref guard, the dirty-worktree refusal and the missing-tree refusal). It needs the pinned ledger corpus through DEV_HERMIT_TEST_LEDGER_ROOT. WHEN IT RUNS: test-harness decides before starting it (ci/manifest-plan/src/self_test_selection.rs). It runs when any path changed since the merge base with origin/main, committed or not, is under one of its known inputs (SCORECARD_INPUTS in ci/manifest-plan/src/validation_dag.rs: the directories ci/compat-envelope/, ci/manifest-plan/, detcore-model/, ci/rust-script-bin/ and tests/e2e/manifests/, and the paths agent-utils (a submodule, whose commit moving counts), .gitmodules, Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, rust-toolchain.toml, scripts/lib/rust_script_prelude.rs, ci/prepare-rust-scripts.sh, ci/prepare-scorecard-self-test-corpus.sh and ci/expected-e2e-plan.json; a deleted or renamed path counts under its old and its new name); it always runs when HEAD is contained in main (refs/heads/main or any refs/remotes/*/main); it also runs when the change set cannot be resolved (a shallow clone, no origin/main, an empty change set, any git failure) and when HERMIT_SELFTEST_SELECTION=all. Otherwise it prints one line containing "NOT RUN by file selection:" that names the merge base and the changed paths, and passes; that line is the node's summary. This node is a leaf: a failure makes the validation red and no node depends on it. PARTS: the tier runs as four child processes (`self-test-commands --parts 4` is the default). Each child builds the same scratch fixtures and runs its share of the 42 commands segments, assigned by their measured times; every segment runs in exactly one child. The child that runs a segment restores the fixture paths it lists (every fixture path except the Git repositories' internals, of which only HEAD, packed-refs and refs/ count) and fails if the segment changed the clone's Git status, any fixture repository's index, worktree list or configuration, or the clone's ignored files, none of which a restore returns; reflogs, object stores and state outside the fixtures (the plan caches, the shared Cargo target directory) are not compared. The parent fails unless every child passes and all report the same segment table, the same fixture state before each segment and the same final fixture state; that shows the children built the same fixtures, and is not a second check of a segment's restore, since each segment runs in one child. Each child's output is copied line by line as it arrives, after `[part K/N]`, and the parent waits for every child before it returns. Measured 2026-10-06 on the development host recorded in docs/TESTING_ENVIRONMENTS.md, "Named measurement hosts", at Hermit 6a029e95 plus this change, with the prepared scorecard binary, each run in a systemd scope, alternating with main's single-process tier: four parts under a 6-core quota and a 14 GiB bound took 77.68-78.90 s wall and 396.5-403.1 CPU seconds in four runs at load average 14-47 (one more run failed in 12 s because a concurrent cargo test in the same checkout swapped the shared helper binary, which the tier refuses); without the Git-state check above they took 72.45-81.85 s and 363.6-402.3 CPU seconds in six runs at load average 14-36, and 95.74 s and 521.1 CPU seconds (307.2 of them system) in one run at load average 73; main's tier under its 2-core quota and 5 GiB bound took 207.10-209.36 s and 274.3-276.3 CPU seconds in five runs. A 4-core quota gave 91.26-93.84 s, so the node asks for 6 cores. The extra CPU is the fixture setup each child repeats, mostly system CPU. MEMORY: each child holds the tier's own working set, about 0.9-1.2 GB resident (the decoded pinned ledger corpus, the derived catalogue and the in-process commands' data; main's single process holds 1.3 GB plus 0.67 GB for its observe-results child, and the corpus and derived fixture state are freed once the fixtures are written), so four children peaked at 5.96-6.38 GB anonymous and 7.94-9.71 GB cgroup memory.peak (page cache included; GB here is 10^9 bytes); before the corpus was freed, six runs (under 4- and 6-core quotas) peaked at 6.95-7.43 GB anonymous and 9.40-9.94 GB memory.peak. The declared working set is 10 GiB, above every memory.peak measured, and the hard bound is 14 GiB, 1.51 times the largest (9.94 GB, 9.26 GiB). Under the old 5 GiB bound four children hit memory.max 56,776 times and ran 109 s, and eight thrashed (682 s of system CPU). The 1800-second wall comes from the single-process tier's largest sample, 1183.84 s wall and 914.53 CPU seconds at load average 215-233, inside the undivided self-test with the telemetry git wrapper first on PATH; it is 1.52 times that sample. The four parts were not measured under that load. At equal load they use 1.46 times the single process's CPU (402.3 against 275.8 CPU seconds), the fixture setup that each child repeats, which projects that sample to 1334 CPU seconds; the 2100 CPU seconds are 1.57 times that projection and 5.2 times the largest four-part sample at low load. The cost is process creation (system CPU) for the scratch repositories' git commands; removing those repositories is the remaining step recorded in https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3381. It does not take the prepared helper that selftest.scorecard uses: it refuses HERMIT_MANIFEST_PLAN_BIN, because its command-line brackets check the helper that Cargo builds in the shared target directory. KNOWN WALL RISK, NOT MEASURED: it runs `cargo build` and `cargo run -p hermit-manifest-plan` against the checkout's target directory, and forces CARGO_TARGET_DIR=<checkout>/target for its result commands, so it waits on Cargo's build-directory lock while a concurrent product build holds it. In the full local validation of Hermit 84da7b816939, build.workspace held that directory for 618.8 seconds (379.0 to 997.9 s after the start); that window plus the single-process tier's 480.80-second sample (2026-09-29, at Hermit 84da7b81, load average 158 falling to 89) is 1099.6 seconds, inside the 1800-second wall."########,

The two lists are joined by hand and nothing compared them: cargo cannot, because the client is C and the link happens when DynamoRIO loads it. MEASURED 2026-08-20: test.dbt_parity had been red nine days on one missing symbol, and advancing the Reverie pin took the gap from one to five while every build stayed green. This node compares the two dynamic symbol tables and names the missing callbacks, which DynamoRIO's own '<ERROR: using undefined symbol!>' never does. test.dbt_parity was retired in slice S13 of https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3301 and its 28 cases became DBT verify cells of the c-programs and system-utils manifests, so e2e.manifest_c_programs, e2e.manifest_system_utils and privileged-e2e.manifest_c_programs depend on this node. THOSE DEPENDENCIES ARE AN ORDERING FIX, NOT A DATA DEPENDENCY: nothing this node produces is consumed; the check runs first so a missing callback is named before eager-exit can cancel it. The cost is that a failure here skips those nodes' cells on every backend for that run, which is already red with the cause named. The e2e _on_host twins do not depend on it: the hosted-portable workflow runs each of them as its own job through ci/run-node.sh, which omits dependencies outside the job's selection, while this node runs in the separate dbt-runtime-abi release-shard job, which an E2E failure cannot cancel; ci/check-shard-coverage.sh therefore refuses an E2E edge to a node that no earlier hosted job supplies. The privileged-only-e2e nodes do not depend on it because this node is not in the privileged or hosted-privileged profiles."########,

Its only caller was .github/workflows/ci-portable.yml, which builds the hosted matrix from the shard map, and hosted CI has not run since 2026-08-11 -- so the guard reported to nobody while TWO nodes drifted out of the map behind it: check.dbt_runtime_abi, corrected per-node on 2026-08-21 by 3b6cd503cc, and check.exit_status_class, corrected in this change. A guard whose only scheduler is dormant is indistinguishable from no guard, which is why this node runs it in the lane that actually executes: scripts/validate.rs selects the portable label from validate.json directly, so a node listed here runs on every local validate. THE UNASSIGNED NODE IS NOT MERELY UNRUN EVERYWHERE. Local validate reads the DAG, so check.exit_status_class HAS been running and failing there (measured: 6 of 6 recent local validates ran it, 0 passed) while never running on the hosted lane. This node is itself listed in preflight_nodes, because a guard against unassigned nodes that is itself unassigned is the same defect wearing the fix's clothes."########,

The rename arrives through a SUBMODULE PIN BUMP, so no hermit build target fails when a hermit-side reference goes stale -- which is exactly how main broke at 4b9a56bfc2: cargo build, test and clippy all stayed green while ci/run-dag.sh and ci/run-node.sh could not locate the runner at all and NO DAG NODE COULD EXECUTE. This node holds the retired spellings at zero in forward-looking files, and separately asserts that the Python and Rust JOBS_ENV_ENV constants match each other and Hermit's export. That second check is not decoration: it is how a node's declared build width reaches Cargo, and if any of the three names diverge, one or both engines silently fall back to the ambient 8 -- the width fix would revert itself in silence.

The node points at the target rather than at scripts, so a checker added to the recipe is gated without a DAG edit, and scripts/check-checker-scheduling.rs refuses a checker that neither the recipe nor a DAG command reaches. The two cargo passes run as lint.rustfmt and lint.clippy, the rust-script unit tests as check.script_unit_tests, and the parent-only canonical-adapter accept arm as check.canonical_adapter_accept. Exit 75 means a checker could not be evaluated from this checkout, for example uninitialized submodules, and is a no-result, never a pass. Each checker is its own make target, and the node runs `make -jN -k -Otarget lint-checks` with N from HERMIT_LINT_CHECK_JOBS, which dagrun sets to this node's 8-core width: -k reports every failing checker by target name, and -Otarget prints each checker's output whole so a NO-RESULT-CASE marker stays at column 0. Until 2026-10-04 the checkers ran as serial lines of one recipe under a one-core cap, so the node's wall time was the sum of their CPU time: 366 seconds in the full validation of 20d49d84. Run alone, scripts/check-checker-scheduling.rs took 141 seconds before its prefilter and 2 after. On one tree, the per-target checkers took 312 seconds of wall time with one job and 72 to 75 with eight. Measured again at 32e2d4bb3e on 2026-10-05 on the lint-checks host in docs/TESTING_ENVIRONMENTS.md, Named measurement hosts, the node's anonymous memory peaked at 1.46 GB with eight jobs and 4.18 GB with 44, one per checker; the cgroup's memory.peak, which also counts page cache, read 1.8 to 3.7 GB with eight. So the 2 GiB baseline covers the eight-job working set and the 4 GiB bound leaves room for reclaimable cache. More jobs did not shorten the node: 66 to 73 seconds with 8, 16 or 44, because scripts/test-authority-obtained-once.sh alone takes 67 to 71 seconds.

The harnesses are independent processes; up to HERMIT_SCRIPT_TEST_JOBS of them run at once, which dagrun sets to this node's 8-core width, and each harness's stdout and stderr are printed whole, on their own streams, as soon as it finishes. Until 2026-09-30 they ran serially inside check.lint_checks under that node's one-core CPU cap, where they took about 890 of its 1,194 seconds at d44bbbb79acd. ci/compat-envelope/scorecard.rs runs as four processes, each given a disjoint share of the harness's own test list by exact name and required to report exactly that share as run and the rest as filtered out: 49 of its 165 tests hold one process-wide lock for the environment and working directory they change, so in one process they ran one at a time (47 of them took 304 seconds serially at a25b3fcd3805) and bounded this node at about 300 seconds. With the shards and the scripts/validate.rs Nextest fixture's wrapper build at eight Cargo jobs, the whole run took 219, 226 and 219 seconds against 399, 428 and 402 unsharded, under an 8-core quota on 2026-10-06 with this change applied to a25b3fcd3805, and used about 1,500 CPU-seconds, so this width, not one harness, now bounds it. Measured again on 2026-10-06 at 9b495ceb3f on a clean checkout with build.rust_scripts run first, three runs under the same quota and the 8 GiB bound on the host named for this node in docs/TESTING_ENVIRONMENTS.md, Named measurement hosts, with every suite passing: anonymous memory peaked at 4.87, 5.05 and 4.80 GiB and stayed above 4 GiB for 58, 54 and 58 seconds of runs lasting 219, 217 and 221 seconds; the cgroup's memory.peak, which also counts page cache, read 6.50, 6.53 and 6.63 GiB, and the kernel reclaimed nothing at the bound. At the anonymous peak the ci/compat-envelope/pressure-test.rs harness held 1.6 to 2.5 GiB, the four scorecard shards 1.0 to 1.2 GiB between them, and the Cargo builds that scripts/validate.rs tests start in temporary checkouts 0.8 to 1.4 GiB (sums of per-process resident sizes, which count shared pages more than once). An earlier run whose rust-script cache and hermit-manifest-plan debug build were stale peaked at 5.60 GiB: the scorecard harness rebuilt hermit-manifest-plan in the checkout (one rustc at 1.2 GiB) while a validate.rs test compiled scripts/validate.rs (1.0 GiB). The seven full validations after the shards landed, through 0e176d54bd, recorded memory.peak of 5.69 to 6.26 GiB for this node in 172 to 185 seconds, against 3.61 to 3.69 GiB in 295 to 300 seconds in the five unsharded runs just before; those later runs also carry the eight-job wrapper build, so the two changes are not separated by that data. So the 6.5 GiB baseline covers every anonymous peak measured and every memory.peak a full validation recorded. The bound is 10 GiB since 2026-10-08, about 50% over the highest memory.peak measured (6.63 GiB): at 8 GiB the node sat at its cap with the kernel reclaiming cache (memory.events max=5487 in a full validation of 608ef0de), and two uncapped runs at c715720e under a 16 GiB box measured memory.peak 5.35 and 3.25 GiB. Building the Nextest fixture's CPU wrapper at four Cargo jobs instead of eight, measured in alternation with the three runs above, did not lower the peak (4.73, 4.86 and 4.85 GiB; the wrapper build is not running at the peak) and shortened the time above 4 GiB to 33 to 40 seconds, but every run took longer, 225 to 226 seconds. Running fewer harnesses at once would not keep the speedup either: across the three runs the pressure-test harness ran for 180 to 183 seconds, scripts/validate.rs for 188 to 192, and three of the four scorecard shards for 186 to 209, so holding back any of them lengthens the node."########,

That is a host capability in the same sense as /dev/kvm, and this node is labelled `full` ONLY because local `scripts/validate.rs full` is the one lane whose checkouts sit under the parent: the hosted-portable and portable lanes check out bare Hermit on GitHub runners, and the privileged, hosted-privileged and super lanes use actions/checkout into the runner workspace. Until 2026-09-29 the arm ran inside check.lint_checks, which is also labelled hosted-portable, so every hosted run of that node could only report NO RESULT (exit 75) for it and the hosted workflow was red with every checker passing: https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/actions/runs/36550265580 and https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/actions/runs/36532203200. `make lint-checks` now runs the stop-path file with --exclude-canonical-adapter-accept-arm and prints that the arm is NOT COVERED by that run and that this node covers it; that exclude mode fails unless this node exists, is the only command that runs the arm, carries exactly the `full` label, and invokes the script directly. The command is a direct python3 invocation, not a make recipe, because make collapses a recipe's exit 75 into its own error and would turn a missing parent into a failure. Outcomes: 0 when the real adapter accepted one production-shaped schema-5 write into its stop-test spool and left the retired raw shadow and the published ledger untouched; 75 (no_result, with a NO-RESULT-CASE line) when no parent adapter is on any ancestor directory; any other nonzero is a failure.

Either way the selected bytes are installed at target/ci/hermit, the ONE path every direct consumer names (compatibility cells, test.cli, test.sabre_examples, test.envelope_levels), with libdetcore_sabre.so copied beside it and hashed before and after the copy; resources resolve through target/install_pkg. The same bytes are then published as a unique content-addressed directory plus pointer: the publisher hashes the binary before and after copying, snapshots target/install_pkg with symlinks dereferenced, verifies the required DBT/SaBRe/LiteInst/e9patch resources and the complete resource hash manifest, and atomically updates the pointer that the E2E manifest runs and ci/run-with-hermit-e2e-artifact.sh consumers read. The validate ledger records the choice as release_builder and e2e_payload, and a Buck row is neither a Cargo cache hit nor a receipt. Cargo does not hash-suffix binary outputs, so each preparation selection that links the Hermit bin relinks target/validate/hermit; the preparation record hashes it after the last selection, and this node publishes exactly those bytes instead of rebuilding (a rebuild here recompiled Hermit and hit the 120-second cap in the first one-build validation, and would have diverged from the recorded runtime file).

Validation run validate-coord-s15-fdd8f55a8e7c (Hermit fdd8f55a8e7c, 2026-09-28) measured the two nodes at 128.62 s and 75.76 s of wall time (about 204 s together), 844 s and 510 s of CPU time (1354 s together, under the unchanged 7200 s CPU bound), and peaks of 3862880256 and 3859349504 bytes at width 8. The wall bound rises from 600 s to 900 s and the estimate from 300 s to 480 s, the sum of the two former estimates; memory bounds are unchanged because peak memory follows the worker width, which stays 8, not the number of cells. The selector no longer passes --allow-empty: a c-programs node that selects no cells now fails instead of passing having run nothing. WORKER WIDTH measured 2026-08-23: recent 20-way validation runs rotated an identical empty early-Run1 no_result across unrelated ptrace cells, while each affected cell passed in another run. A focused run at eight workers completed all 127 selected strict rows in 264.3s with 127 canonical matches and no no_result, leaving a measured 335.7s margin to the unchanged 600s hang bound. This node reserves all 8 manifest_guest slots and passes the same width to the harness; ordinary Hermit gates may overlap now that their unsupported exclusive resource is removed. Tradeoff: blocking validation still does not exercise the former 20-way manifest pressure; every cell and the strict comparator remain enabled and unchanged. MEMORY measured 2026-08-25 at Hermit 16f70d9994 with the complete current-main artifact and width 8 under ambient load 40-107: five uncapped cgroup peaks were 2855145472-2894295040 bytes; three stricter 4-GiB-cap repetitions completed all 128 cells with peaks up to 3025047552 bytes and no cgroup kill. The 4-GiB baseline rounds above the observed high-water mark; the 6-GiB hard cap preserves nearly 3 GiB of runaway headroom without reserving the former unmeasured 32 GiB."########,

Those are the replay cells of the rows' own tests compat/<row>, from the corpus's `replay` section: one ptrace replay cell for each row but the lua, perl and df -direct twins and netlink-sock-diag, 215 in all: the 139 programs the retired rr lane listed as passing (ci/compat/corpus-rr.json and RR_PASSING_LABELS until 2026-10-02) and, since 2026-10-09, 76 of the 77 rows it never listed, each running `hermit record start --strict --verify` under the stricter --verify-strict comparison, which records the program, replays the recording and compares the two, with the old lane's 60-second wall bound per program. It runs the validation's one Hermit build, the e2e artifact build.host_hermit_link links on the host, against the fixtures rrcompatprep.fixtures writes. The old lane ran `record start --verify --verify-strict`; the harness adds what every manifest replay cell has: --strict, --log info, --base-env=minimal, and a tmpfs /test working directory. On 2026-10-02 only 51 passed, on the old lane's own command too, because the other 88 stopped recording with exit status 122 at their first clock read (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3519); record mode now records clock reads, and on 2026-10-08 at 27eab6dc only make and node of those 88 still failed, because their replay readmitted a different backgrounded thread than the recording (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3934); the rejoin log of https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/pull/3908 fixed that, and the node gated all 139. A three-run survey on 2026-10-09 gave the other 77 rows replay cells: 73 recorded and replayed at canonical bitwise parity in 3 of 3 runs and joined, and timeout, flex and lsof stayed `unselected` under their issues; flex joined once its replay stall, a pipe write captured as container output, was fixed (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3964), timeout once its false rt_sigsuspend deadlock in record was fixed (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3963), and lsof stays. netlink-sock-diag is excepted: its own check asserts Detcore's run-mode sock_diag sanitizer, which record/replay disables by design, and its replay matched the recording bitwise (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3965). The node now gates 214 cells: any of them that diverges, crashes or exceeds its budget turns it red. Until 2026-10-02 these rows were 139 separate rrcompat.<program> nodes running a separately built release Hermit, and until 2026-10-04 139 separate compat/rr-<row> tests duplicating the rows' own tests. Like the old lane's command, each replay cell runs without the corpus's verify settings: no added Hermit flags or comparator, no TMPDIR=/tmp, and one attempt. The node's 600-second wall bound is the 200 seconds `scripts/validate.rs --self-test` requires of it as outer headroom (two modelled attempts of the largest cell, 60 seconds scaled by the representative 1.5x multiplier, each with 10 seconds of termination grace: 2 x (90 + 10)), plus 400 seconds for the rest of the bucket; the 139 cells took 34 seconds of wall time at up to 8 workers on 2026-10-08 (149 seconds of summed cell time and 72 CPU seconds for the 137 that passed then; the slowest, java, 26.8 seconds; with all 139 passing at 7be21e8f on 2026-10-09, 139.2 seconds of summed cell time and 77.8 CPU seconds, the slowest, java, 33.4 seconds), against 56.7 seconds on 2026-10-02 for the 51 programs that passed then, run one after another through the old command. The two attempts are that conservative model only; the harness never retries a replay cell, so a recording that fails to replay fails its one attempt, as it did on the old lane."########,

Those are each corpus row's SaBRe verify cell (the `focused` section: every row but lsof, netlink-route, netlink-sock-diag and shell-build) and both cells of the 30 rows only this run type has (23 programs the SaBRe corpus had and the strict corpus lacks; lua-direct, perl-direct and df-direct, which keep that corpus's single-image argv for programs whose strict rows run under a bash wrapper; and rustc, javac, java and node, whose ptrace cells get 600 seconds). It runs the validation's one Hermit build, the e2e artifact build.host_hermit_link links on the host, whose install tree carries the SaBRe loader and libdetcore_sabre.so, against the fixtures sabrecompatprep.fixtures writes; each cell runs Hermit's strict --verify (--verify-strict) once and must also pass the harness's SaBRe execution-path contract (an RPC from the in-guest tool, zero ptrace-fallback and zero trusted shared-object system-call sites). A cell measured red stays enabled with `ci: false` and its failure class's issue (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3486 and the issues it names), so `--ci-only` selects only the cells that pass. The guest's own dynamic loader loads libdetcore_sabre.so against the guest's libc, so the artifact's publication and verification refuse a plugin that records a library search path, needs a library outside glibc, or requires a glibc symbol version newer than 2.34 (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3652). A program that diverges, crashes or leaves SaBRe's measured path turns it red. Until 2026-10-01 these rows were 212 separate sabrecompat.<program> nodes that checked only Hermit's exit status, so a program whose children ran outside SaBRe passed, and on a fresh checkout their release Hermit had no SaBRe loader at all. The node's 2120-second wall bound is the 1820 seconds `scripts/validate.rs --self-test` requires of it as outer headroom, plus 300 seconds for the rest of the bucket, so a hung heavy cell is reported as that cell's timeout rather than ending the node. The self-test models every manifest cell as two attempts with 10 seconds of termination grace each, and its representative 1.5x wall multiplier turns the largest selected cells (rustc and node on ptrace, 600 seconds each) into 900-second windows: 2 x (900 + 10).

MEMORY RECALIBRATED 2026-08-25 (task remeasure_the_fourteen_stale): five current exact-command cgroup samples peaked at 279248896 bytes after the feature widening; the larger width-8 historical calibration of 4.0 GiB governs.

See doc.rustdoc for the shared derivation; jobs_flag is empty so the declaration sizes the cgroup box only and never edits argv. PROFILE 2026-09-30: stays in Cargo's dev profile, like lint.clippy and doc.rustdoc. In the first one-build validation that ran it with --profile validate, the doctest build after the nextest preparation was not fresh: it recompiled reverie-dbt, hermit-install (whose build script restages target/install_pkg), detcore-dbt and hermit in target/validate while prepared test nodes ran, and six of them refused with 'prepared executable, package identity, or runtime file changed'. In the dev profile hermit-install's build script exits immediately and nothing under target/validate is written. MEM-CAP RE-DERIVATION 2026-09-30: the 2-GiB cap above was derived on a WARM host target that a debug workspace build had filled. In the pinned root no node builds dev-profile libraries first (clippy and rustdoc produce metadata only), so this node compiles the workspace libraries cold; with the 2-GiB cap it was OOM-killed after 23 s (4 oom_kill events) in the validation of hermit 63a043595. The cold dev-profile clippy at the same CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8 completes under its 6-GiB cap, so rss_baseline is 4 GiB and hard_mem_max_bytes 8 GiB until a cold cgroup-recorded peak is measured."########,

        description: r########"MEM-CAP RE-DERIVATION 2026-10-06 (doc.rustdoc OOM-killed on hermit main): rss_baseline 1505439744 -> 4359524352 and hard_mem_max_bytes 3221225472 (3.0 GiB) -> 7516192768 (7.0 GiB). WHY: the 2026-08-25 figure below was measured WARM (only target/doc removed), but the pinned-root node starts from a cold or nearly cold dev-profile target under ignored/hermetic/split/target, so before documenting 15 crates it compiles 34-54 units (build scripts and their dependencies) and checks about 190 crates. Cold, it presses on the 3 GiB cap. EVIDENCE: the Cargo-runner validate of hermit 0a2e0c24 (buck-cargo-repro 20261006T034408Z) was killed at 101.8 s with 13 oom_kill events, peak 3221229568, memory.events max 42600; the cbef0ac8 ops-tick validate was killed at 105.0 s with 9 oom_kill events, peak 3221225472, max 42100. The Buck-runner validate of the same 0a2e0c24 head PASSED in 57.4 s, but its peak_bytes equalled the cap exactly and memory.events max was 9608: it survived by page reclaim at the cap, not by needing less memory, so pass or fail at 3 GiB was a race. METHOD: hermit cbef0ac85172, 2026-10-06 04:40-04:49Z, on the host recorded for node doc.rustdoc under "Named measurement hosts" in docs/TESTING_ENVIRONMENTS.md. The exact pinned-root doc.rustdoc cmd from ci/dag/validate.json, run with CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8 inside an UNCAPPED transient user scope (MemoryAccounting=yes), recording the scope's cgroup memory.peak; run after the split fetch phase and build.rust_scripts_in_pinned_root, as in validate. Cold = target/debug, target/doc, .rustdoc_fingerprint.json and .rustc_info.json removed so only target/ci remains (254-269 units built). n=6 cold runs, all exit 0 with zero memory.events max/oom: 4247703552, 4359524352 and 4048121856 bytes with the container seeing all 316 host CPUs (taskset affinity is not inherited into the container), then 3890401280, 3997745152 and 4209971200 bytes with AllowedCPUs=240-247 on the scope, so nproc=8 as under the validate runner. The highest, 4359524352 (4.06 GiB), is recorded as rss_baseline. In 0.5 s samples, anon memory (not reclaimable without swap) peaked at 2.47-2.66 GiB; at each run's highest memory.current sample, file cache was 1.06-1.28 GB and everything else (kernel and other) under 4%. Reclaimable file cache is why a 3 GiB cap sometimes survives. Cold wall clock was 60.2-61.8 s with 8 CPUs (47.2-54.1 s when the container saw 316 CPUs). CONFIRMATION on this change's base, hermit 04b389291e0d (reverie pin d2257c06), 2026-10-06 05:07-05:11Z, same method with AllowedCPUs=240-247: three more cold runs peaked at 3643789312, 3324948480 and 3324235776 bytes (3.39, 3.10 and 3.10 GiB) in 58.7-60.7 s, all exit 0, all above the old 3 GiB cap and below the cbef0ac maximum. Warm control (0 units compiled, 15 crates documented): 1929154560 bytes (316 CPUs) and 1497948160 bytes (8 CPUs), the latter reproducing the 08-25 figure and confirming that figure was the warm case. HEADROOM: 7516192768 / 4359524352 = 1.72x the highest cold peak, above the 1.5x (50% headroom) floor. est_duration_s (150) unchanged: the cold 8-CPU 59-62 s fits inside it. MEM RE-DERIVATION 2026-08-25 (task re_derive_doc_rustdoc): rss_baseline 1181116006 -> 1505439744. The previous figure PREDATED the --all-features/-D warnings change and I flagged it stale when I made that change; this replaces it rather than leaving the caveat standing. method=cgroup-RECORDED (systemd-run --user -p MemoryAccounting=yes, MemoryPeak == cgroup memory.peak), pinned_jobs=8 via the CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8 prefix, target_state=warm with `rm -rf target/doc` first so rustdoc actually reruns. n=2 complete runs, both result=success: 1505439744 and 1491546112 bytes (1.402 and 1.389 GiB); the larger is recorded. A THIRD, COLDER, INCOMPLETE run peaked HIGHER at 1913589760 (1.78 GiB) before it was killed, so a cold-cache run costs more than this warm figure and 1.78 GiB is a lower bound for that case -- the existing 3 GiB hard cap still clears it, which is why hard_mem_max_bytes is UNCHANGED. ⚠️ est_duration_s DELIBERATELY NOT UPDATED. Warm wall clock here was 12s against the recorded 150, but this box reports 316 effective CPUs (see the run-with-reverie-dbt-budget.sh banner), so its wall clock is not transferable to a CI runner. CPU time consumed was 33.4s, which is the portable number if anyone wants to re-derive duration properly. Memory peak transfers; wall clock on a 316-CPU host does not. ENFORCEMENT 2026-08-25 (task doc_rustdoc_cannot_fail): RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings added. Until now this node ran cargo doc with no RUSTDOCFLAGS, so it EXITED 0 WHILE EMITTING WARNINGS -- it rendered documentation and could not fail on documentation defects. Measured against the real pre-fix source at 89288ed6ad^: the old command exits 0 with 3 warnings; with -D warnings it exits 101 and names both offending items and lines. --all-features added alongside, and HONESTLY IT IS PRECAUTIONARY RATHER THAN A FIX: measured today it changes nothing for rustdoc -- 13 crates and 920 HTML pages either way, zero delta -- because the feature-gated items in hermit-cli are #[doc(hidden)] re-exports and detcore-dbt is a workspace member documented regardless. It is here so that a DOCUMENTED item placed behind a feature gate later cannot become invisible, which is the mechanism that hid clippy findings until e602aaa991. Do not read it as closing a live gap. .github/workflows/docs.yml deliberately NOT changed: it PUBLISHES to gh-pages rather than gating, and a publisher that refuses to publish over a doc warning is a worse trade. MEM/CPU DERIVATION 2026-08-10 (tasks memory-caps-must-scale-with-job-count, fix_doc_rustdoc_dynamorio and p0_dynamorio_build_cache): pinned_jobs=8 via both CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8 and preferred_inner_jobs=8. THIS NODE CARRIES THE SHARED DERIVATION for every step whose preferred width is delivered through the CARGO_BUILD_JOBS jobs_env channel; target/debug/test-harness enforces the pairing as a rule over all such steps. The explicit preferred width is load-bearing: safe-ci's declarations-first default (agent-utils DEFAULT_SMALL_CPU_COUNT=1) otherwise boxes this eight-worker cold DynamoRIO build to cpu.max=1 core while the DBT ratchet derives 132s from eight effective workers. ROOT CAUSE, measured: hermit ab4a8c08 advanced the agent-utils gitlink a6f4232 ('make the SMALL default cap OPT-IN, default OFF') -> 1d893fbc, which contains ada564d ('activate small undeclared-step caps'); every head that failed pins the activated runner and both heads that passed pin a6f4232. LIVE CGROUP READ with the runner built at the pinned SHA, each step reporting its own /proc/self/cgroup -> cpu.max: an undeclared step gets '100000 100000' (1 core) and a preferred_inner_jobs=8 step gets '800000 100000' (8 cores). A/B ON THE IDENTICAL DynamoRIO cmake build --parallel 8 (316-core validation host, load avg 46): unboxed 15.37s wall / 102.51 CPU-s at 666% CPU, versus CPUQuota=100% 112.23s wall / 112.01 CPU-s at 99% CPU; cmake configure is a further 3.65s serial. 112s at one core is already 85% of the 132s budget for the build alone, and sharing that core with the node's concurrent rustdoc/cargo work produced the observed 185.51/187.79/188.06/286.70s. CONTROL: build.workspace and build.runtime_release were the only steps that already declared a width (32) and were the only cpu-bound steps that did not regress (91s -> 88s), while undeclared test.detcore_unit went 34s -> 103s. The 132s ratchet is UNCHANGED and stays fully live: 15.4s observed against 132s once eight cores are actually delivered. jobs_flag is empty so the declaration sizes the cgroup box only; CARGO_BUILD_JOBS already conveys the width to Cargo, and appending '-j 8' would edit argv (harmless here, but it would reach libtest or rustc on three sibling steps). rss_baseline=measured_peak@j8=1.1GiB; method=cgroup-RECORDED (systemd MemoryPeak == cgroup memory.peak, NOT sampled); target_state=warm Rust artifacts but a distinct cargo-doc reverie-dbt build-script OUT_DIR can still cold-build DynamoRIO; hermit@21b22c2b. headroom=+1.9GiB additive -> hard_mem_max_bytes=3.0GiB.

The 5-GiB scheduling baseline rounds above that floor and the 7-GiB hard cap adds 2 GiB of headroom. CPU WIDTH remains pinned at 8 for the build phase while nextest execution remains -j1. See ai_docs/dag-memory-caps-recalibration-20260825.md. TEST CONCURRENCY -j1 EXPLAINED 2026-08-26 (task goal-5-build-the-validate-parallel-scaling-model-1-to-316-threads): the -j1 is DELIBERATE, not a default. It preserves a --test-threads=1 introduced 2026-07-27 in 6044c2d39a and carried to nextest -j1 on 2026-08-10 in 3dc3a08a79, whose message says 'Preserve serial execution where Hermit tests require it'. The sibling test.detcore_unit (-p hermit-detcore --lib --bins) has never carried it, so the choice is selective. Hermit's INTEGRATION tests get the same serialization by a different route -- .config/nextest.toml caps the test-group hermit-serialized at max-threads 1 over filter package(=hermit) & kind(=test) & !binary(=cli) (the cli binary runs at the width the DAG gives test.cli; see that node); --lib and --bins are NOT kind(=test), which is why this node needs the flag instead. That file states the reason above the group: the hermit test binaries 'use process-local mutexes to serialize Hermit executions', and several tests here do execute Hermit (for example run::detects_symlink_resolution_through_implicit_mounts and the verify::tests::* family). MEASURED COST OF THE PIN: 1.93x. Two replicates each at a6b0c37648df on the host recorded for this measurement in docs/TESTING_ENVIRONMENTS.md under Named measurement hosts, -j1 gave 27.0s and 27.3s against -j16 at 14.4s and 13.7s. WARNING FOR WHOEVER MEASURES THIS NEXT -- TWO DISTINCT KNOBS, DO NOT PUT THEM ON ONE AXIS. CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8 bounds BUILD width; nextest -j bounds TEST concurrency. The 1.93x is attributable to -j alone; the wrapper's build width was unchanged throughout. Plotting a build width and a test concurrency on one axis produces a smooth curve that means nothing. Those figures are WARM-REPEAT times, not node times: this node takes 57.6s in a full validate. The SPEEDUP transfers, the absolute seconds do not. NOT ESTABLISHED: whether the serialization is still necessary. No commit or comment names which lib/bin test requires it. Two -j16 runs returned rc=0 and that is NOT evidence of safety, because a race that only appears under concurrency is exactly what two green runs cannot rule out. Raising this needs someone to confirm Hermit's lib and bin targets are free of the process-local mutex constraint; until then the 1.93x is not claimable. KVM EXECUTION TEST SKIPPED HERE 2026-09-30: the full profile's unified Nextest build compiles the hermit library tests with kvm-execution-tests, which adds kvm_execution_tests::initialized_vm_setup_failures_consume_detcore_state_without_further_guest_execution to this binary; --skip kvm_execution_tests:: keeps this node's population exactly what it ran before, and privileged-test.cli_kvm still runs that test and requires it by name."########,

The 256-MiB scheduling baseline is the next power of two at or above the 115081216-byte maximum plus 20%, the 1-GiB hard cap supplies headroom, and est_duration_s rounds the maximum wall time up to 7 seconds."########,

        description: r########"MEMORY RECALIBRATED 2026-08-25 (task remeasure_the_fourteen_stale): all five current full-population runs were red for existing test failures, so their partial peaks are censored and do not lower the estimate. The last successful historical peak was 5351632896 bytes and an older 4-GiB run OOMed. The 6-GiB baseline rounds above the successful floor and the 8-GiB hard cap preserves 2 GiB more headroom. See ai_docs/dag-memory-caps-recalibration-20260825.md. REGISTRATION 2026-10-05 (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3146): external_signal_interrupt runs here on the ptrace backend. A signal that Linux would deliver must end the tests/c/external_signal_interrupt.c guest's blocked futex, poll, epoll, select or child wait, and an ignored, blocked or default-ignored signal must leave the wait running to its deadline. test.liteinst_strict, where earlier rounds of https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/pull/3361 registered the binary, no longer exists, and the binary's LiteInst cells are restoration targets (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3745). PMU CASES MOVED 2026-10-07: 25 external_signal_interrupt ptrace cases assert guest-observed virtual-time bounds (a 300 ms timed wait must end within 300-350 virtual ms) or watchdog progress that hold only with the PMU preemption timer. GitHub-hosted runners have no PMU, so hermit falls back to --max-timeslice=disabled, and in https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/actions/runs/37631051557 exactly these 25 failed in test.hermit_integration_on_host (300 ms waits took 454-895 virtual ms). Forcing --max-timeslice=disabled locally fails the same 25 of 69 and no other; with the timer all 69 pass. This node and its hosted twin skip them by exact name and test.pmu_integration_cases runs them after privileged-pmu.preemption has shown the PMU works; the two filters are exact complements over this selection, so the full label runs each case once."########,

        description: r########"Runs every test in hermit-cli/tests/record_replay.rs, all 140 of its Nextest identities, on one thread in the pinned root. Most tests run `hermit record start --verify` (some with --strict --verify-strict and a --verify-json verdict, some as separate record and `replay --autopilot` invocations) under a `timeout --kill-after=5s 45s` wrapper with --record-timeout=30, against the C and Rust workloads that build.workspace_in_pinned_root prepares and the prepared Nextest runner names in HERMIT_PREPARED_RECORD_WORKLOADS, and against host programs such as sh, bash, find, sqlite3 and coreutils pipelines; they require exit 0 and "Success: replay matched recording.", and the strict ones require verified and bitwise_parity in the verdict. They protect record/replay of file-system side effects (including a standalone replay of a mkdir and of AT_FDCWD- and descriptor-relative mkdirat calls beneath host directories that only existed at record time), fork and exec chains, pipes (including a blocking read after the guest clears O_NONBLOCK with FIONBIO or F_SETFL) and socketpairs (a blocking read, recv or recvmsg through the original descriptor, a dup and a forked child's inherited descriptor must wait for its writer, also after the guest clears O_NONBLOCK with FIONBIO or F_SETFL, with a pipe as the control), loopback TCP accept and accept4 (a guest that accepts its own connections must print the same echoed bytes, full and truncated peer address, close-on-exec flag, SOCK_NONBLOCK and EAGAIN and EINVAL failures under record and under a replay that serves both calls from the log, and every replay of one recording of a guest that accepts on one thread, on its own listener or on one received over SCM_RIGHTS, while another opens and closes descriptors must end the same way, either with the recorded output or with replay's named refusal of the accept's descriptor slot (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3880); accept4 with address buffers and *addrlen next to unmapped, read-only, write-only or inaccessible pages, or on a guest stack with little room below it, must return the result, length, copied prefix and untouched tail Linux 7.1 gives, writing the length before the address as Linux 7.1 and later do (7.0 and earlier copy the address first; record uses the 7.1 order on every host), and accept must read *addrlen after it has waited for a connection; a socketpair shutdown must reach a live recvmmsg in replay; and record must refuse sendmmsg and recvmmsg on an accepted connection by name), poll, select, ppoll and pselect copy-outs, futexes, clocks and RDTSC; record timeouts that kill the guest and its descendants without committing a partial recording; replay bootstrap from the recorded executable and interpreter; refusal of an unsupported syscall by name in both phases; and replay output that cannot create a host file through /proc/<pid>/root or truncate stdout through /dev/fd. Eight record_workloads unit tests check how those workloads are built and handed over, including that a consumer refuses a prepared workload whose bytes, path or alias set changed after preparation, and that test processes outside the prepared runner share one content-keyed standalone population instead of building one each (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3946). record_replay_matrix is also what super.record_replay_matrix_diagnostic runs alone. All fourteen network_trace tests run here: one checks the TCP fixture natively against its loopback controller; one runs the fixture's poll and ppoll on a readable pipe, each with nfds's high word set and its low word 1, natively and under --record-networking, and requires both runs to print one ready entry for each call, because Linux reads nfds as an unsigned int and record reads the pollfd array before it knows whether the call names a channel; three record and replay it with 4-KiB socket buffers that fill, one checking that a nonblocking send replays EAGAIN at the same offset, one that a blocking send does not stall a sibling thread, and one that replay refuses a blocking send where the recording holds a refused nonblocking send and that record refuses another send on the connection while a blocking send waits; three more check what happens around that wait: one records a client that prints whether the thread that released the peer had run and its monotonic clock before and after the send, replays it offline in the same configuration and requires the same stdout byte for byte and the same sequence of network-send retry lines in the INFO log, one requires record to refuse, with exit 122, a waiting send whose descriptor number another thread replaced with dup2 while a dup kept the original open, and requires that the replacement connection received no byte, and one sends from a shared file mapping whose unsent half a forked child rewrites during the wait and requires that the recorded outputs equal what the peer received and that the recording replays at L2; and three record the fixture's client with --record-networking against that controller and replay it with --replay-networking after the controller is gone, under four schedules at L2, checking that record and replay refuse socket operations outside the model and that replay refuses changed outbound bytes; one records the client waiting on a connection and a pipe with select, pselect6 and glibc's select and pselect, each result checked against Linux's, and checking that poll and ppoll with more entries than RLIMIT_NOFILE fail with EINVAL though the array names the connection, and replays it offline under two schedules, requiring the same stdout, an L2 verdict and an unchanged trace; one records the pinned root's unmodified curl (nixpkgs' curl.bin, added to the image for https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3786) fetching from a one-shot loopback HTTP server under --strict with --record-networking, replays it with --replay-networking after the server has exited, and requires the same stdout, a matched `hermit log-diff` of the two INFO logs that compared messages on both sides, and an L2 verdict from a --verify-strict replay; the last checks, without running Hermit, that the stdout comparison the backpressure tests share is exact, apart from the observe mode's own lines, which it removes byte for byte. Record/replay does not enable PMU preemption, so the node needs no performance counters. A replay that diverges from its recording, a recording or replay that hangs until its timeout, a prepared workload that fails that check, or a run that executes other than 140 tests fails the node. record_node_eventfd_epoll_sequence, which records and replays `node -e console.log(42)` under --backend=ptrace --strict --verify --verify-strict, was skipped until the rejoin log of https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/pull/3908: at hermit d1744e9fc07e its replay rescheduled the backgrounded DetPid(5) where the recording committed DetPid(3) at scheduler turn 144 (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3782). MEASURED 2026-10-05 in the pinned root at 2ab6a514458d (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/pull/3795 before its est_duration_s and this paragraph were updated, six tests fewer than now; the mkdir, mkdirat and pipe-clear-nonblock tests added since took 2.9 s, 2.5 s and 2.6 s wall in a debug-build nextest run outside the pinned root on 2026-10-06, and the curl test, unskipped since, took 3.2 s there, with 4.7 CPU-s for the whole `cargo nextest run` of that one test, cargo included), by a full validate run (validate-netreplay-rework-2ab6a514458d-1791233575988436941-3055230-bbd98825, off the record) at load average 14: 103 passed, 2 filtered, in 76.7 s wall and 70.6 CPU-s (cgroup cpu.usage_usec; 22.6 user, 48.0 system), with a cgroup memory peak of 152 MiB and 1.8 s of throttling. The 103 tests' own cgroups sum to 64.8 CPU-s. The six tcp_backpressure tests took 9.7, 8.1, 8.1, 6.8, 4.7 and 2.3 CPU-s (the shared-mapping, nonblocking, blocking, refusal, waited-send and replaced-descriptor tests; wall within 0.1 s of each), each under the 22 CPU-s per-test cap; no other test took more than 1.7 CPU-s. The previous measurement, at a67d9d031189 before the three wait tests were added, was 100 passed in 59.5 s wall and 53.2 CPU-s. Earlier runs of the debug-profile build outside the pinned root took 211 to 290 s wall and up to 285 CPU-s; the validate-profile Hermit and prepared workloads account for the difference, so those numbers no longer set the budget. est_duration_s is the pinned-root wall. The 1-GiB baseline rounds the cgroup peak up and the 3-GiB hard cap adds 2 GiB. The 300-second wall timeout is 1.5 times the wall rounded up to the next 300-second bucket, and the 300-second CPU cap applies the same rule to the CPU time."########,

MEMORY RECALIBRATED 2026-08-25 (task remeasure_the_fourteen_stale): five current exact-command cgroup samples peaked at 339279872 bytes; the larger 4068401152-byte historical completed peak governs. The 4-GiB baseline rounds above that floor and the 6-GiB hard cap adds 2 GiB of headroom. See ai_docs/dag-memory-caps-recalibration-20260825.md. PARALLELISM 2026-10-06: the node runs at the width the DAG assigns (preferred 4) through NEXTEST_TEST_THREADS, and .config/nextest.toml keeps the cli binary out of the hermit-serialized group. Nextest runs every test in its own process, so the process-local HERMIT_RUN_LOCK never serialized two tests; until this change the group, and this node's -j 1, kept two cli tests from running at once. Every fixture that the cli binary builds under CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR, including those in the shared tests/common modules it includes, now goes in a directory named for the test process (process_build_root), so two tests running at once never write, or run, the same file. Measured 2026-10-06 with 15 alternating off-the-record runs, five per width: every run passed 166 of 166 with no retried, flaky, timed-out or leaked test; nextest time was 113.7-114.2 s at 1 thread, 59.0-59.1 s at 2 and 33.2-33.5 s at 4; node CPU stayed at 45.7-47.4 CPU-s at every width; the step's memory.peak was 171-183 MB at 1 thread, 227-267 MB at 2 and 269-276 MB at 4, about 35 MB more per added thread and far below the 4-GiB memory hint, which still comes from width-1 calibration. Like every other node whose width channel is NEXTEST_TEST_THREADS, the width is the DAG allocator's: preferred 4, capped by the run's CPU budget, and wider only if a measured speedup curve for this step justifies it; the longest case (about 27 s) bounds what a wider setting could gain. test.cli_on_host, the hosted twin, takes its width the same way. The other nodes that run the cli binary keep one thread with -j 1; for test.isolated_dbt_workdir the explicit -j 1 overrides the width it is assigned."########,

A guest that points its stderr at a pipe and forks a child that only exits must, at --log=warn, read nothing from that pipe on either backend (at --log=info the plugin's DETLOG forwarding still writes there, and that run is only checked for repeatability). Under --verify the plugin sends its DETLOG records on a socket reverie-sabre keeps from the guest, so the run log must match ptrace's through the post-exec AT_RANDOM record, and a guest that dup2s onto every descriptor from 1024 to 1039 must still run to the end with its records in the log. SaBRe letting getrandom return host entropy, a controller line leaking into guest stderr, the plugin's fingerprint warning reaching a forked child's guest stderr, the in-guest records appended after the run instead of interleaved, a run whose forwarded records went missing (a guest that closes the socket before the plugin adopts it) being compared instead of refused, the plugin writing its records into a file the guest made its own stderr after the socket it was given could not be adopted, or the plugin adopting a socket of the guest's own that guest code put at the passed number before the plugin ran, is caught."########,

It consumes the shared cli binary published by privileged-build.privileged_tests and therefore holds the integration_test_binaries.cli token like the other consumers.

One attempt of that case cost 8.2-10.7 CPU-s and 8.4-10.9 s of wall time in 13 local validation runs on 2026-10-09, so five attempts need up to about 54 CPU-s and 55 s; HERMIT_TEST_CPU_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER=4 raises each case's CPU budget from 22 to 88 CPU-s and HERMIT_TEST_WALL_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER=2 its wall bound from 57 to 114 s, since at the defaults a third attempt would be killed by the CPU budget. The retrying case is bounded by its 114 s wall bound, and with the other seven cases (about 30 s together in the 2026-10-06 measurement) the node stays below its 300 s limit."########,

GitHub-hosted runners have no PMU, so hermit continues with --max-timeslice=disabled; in https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/actions/runs/37631051557 at hermit ccbe5ae8 test.hermit_integration_on_host failed exactly these 25, with 300 ms waits taking 454-895 virtual ms. Forcing --max-timeslice=disabled into the cells locally fails the same 25 of the binary's 69 and no other; with the timer all 69 pass. The overshoot without the timer is a product defect of its own, not a test defect, and these assertions keep full force here. test.hermit_integration and its hosted twin skip the 25 by exact name; this node runs the same prepared selection with the complementary filter, so the full label runs each case once, after privileged-pmu.preemption has shown the PMU works. Like the privileged-test PMU nodes it carries only the full label: local scripts/validate.rs full runs it, .github/workflows/ci-privileged.yml does not. It is in the test group, not privileged-test, because it executes the 54 hermit-cli integration binaries of test.hermit_integration and declares them (ci/audit-test-binary-registration.py requires the declaration to match the executed targets); a privileged-* consumer of those binaries would make each one a fused shared binary of privileged-build.privileged_tests, which this node does not use. Memory hints are test.hermit_integration's, whose selection this is.

The six other quick nodes depend on it; the three smoke runs execute the target/debug/hermit it produces. A compile error anywhere in the workspace, including code behind the third-party-backends feature, stops the quick profile here, as does a prepare step that cannot find an executable for that selection. WIDTH AND WALL: it runs at 8 CPUs (CpuBound, preferred_inner_jobs 8, passed to Cargo as CARGO_BUILD_JOBS rather than as a trailing -j, which `nextest-binaries.rs prepare` refuses as an extra argument). As a light node it would get dagrun's default one-CPU box, where the workspace build alone costs about 575 CPU-seconds. In the quick-profile validation of Hermit dcbf2768 on 2026-10-08, on the development host recorded in docs/TESTING_ENVIRONMENTS.md, "Named measurement hosts", it took 152 s. The 1200 s wall is 7.9 times that, and equals the wall of build.workspace_compile_in_pinned_root, whose 124 retained runs took 179-227 s. The wall was 3600 s, which made the quick profile refuse every node once preparation passed 600 s of ci-hub's 4200 s run budget (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3906)."########,

The final command prebuilds the exact cli and hermit_modes integration binaries consumed by the privileged test nodes, so their wall budgets measure test execution instead of Cargo compilation or target-lock waiting. After the bin build, the content-addressed publisher verifies source type/mode/size, hashes before and after copying, verifies the published hash and atomically updates the pointer before any later Cargo invocation can relink target/debug/hermit. This privileged lane deliberately publishes a binary-only artifact; unlike portable DBT/SaBRe/LiteInst cells, it does not consume install_pkg resources.

Where it cannot, this node used to FAIL in 0.11 s with exit 101 and an empty detail block -- indistinguishable from a broken build -- and its eager-exit aborted the twelve other in-flight nodes and filtered twenty-seven more, so a machine that runs 31 of 33 nodes in 3m22s produced no receipt at all. `requires_host_capability` moves that judgement OUT of the node, to an out-of-band probe run during plan construction, and makes the outcome a third recorded state: host-inapplicable, which is neither a pass nor a failure and is written to the ledger as a typed intentional skip. THIS DOES NOT WEAKEN THE TEST. Where the capability is present the node runs unchanged and its assertions keep full force; the probe fails closed toward running, so a probe error or an unexpected errno still runs it.

Validation run validate-coord-s15-fdd8f55a8e7c (Hermit fdd8f55a8e7c, 2026-09-28) measured the two nodes at 128.62 s and 75.76 s of wall time (about 204 s together), 844 s and 510 s of CPU time (1354 s together, under the unchanged 7200 s CPU bound), and peaks of 3862880256 and 3859349504 bytes at width 8. The wall bound rises from 600 s to 900 s and the estimate from 300 s to 480 s, the sum of the two former estimates; memory bounds are unchanged because peak memory follows the worker width, which stays 8, not the number of cells. The selector no longer passes --allow-empty: a c-programs node that selects no cells now fails instead of passing having run nothing. WORKER WIDTH measured 2026-08-23: recent 20-way validation runs rotated an identical empty early-Run1 no_result across unrelated ptrace cells, while each affected cell passed in another run. A focused run at eight workers completed all 127 selected strict rows in 264.3s with 127 canonical matches and no no_result, leaving a measured 335.7s margin to the unchanged 600s hang bound. This node reserves all 8 manifest_guest slots and passes the same width to the harness; ordinary Hermit gates may overlap now that their unsupported exclusive resource is removed. Tradeoff: blocking validation still does not exercise the former 20-way manifest pressure; every cell and the strict comparator remain enabled and unchanged. MEMORY measured 2026-08-25 at Hermit 16f70d9994 with the complete current-main artifact and width 8 under ambient load 40-107: five uncapped cgroup peaks were 2855145472-2894295040 bytes; three stricter 4-GiB-cap repetitions completed all 128 cells with peaks up to 3025047552 bytes and no cgroup kill. The 4-GiB baseline rounds above the observed high-water mark; the 6-GiB hard cap preserves nearly 3 GiB of runaway headroom without reserving the former unmeasured 32 GiB."########,

Cap KEPT at the existing generous 8.0GiB: a warm/incremental measurement read peak_bytes~1.64GiB @j8, but that reused build.workspace artifacts and UNDER-estimates a cold from-scratch privileged build, so the 8.0GiB headroom is retained rather than tightened on an unreliable warm figure. rss_baseline=5.0GiB (scheduling reservation). hermit@b384187e."########,

THIS DOES NOT WEAKEN THE TEST. Where the capability is present the node runs unchanged and its assertions keep full force; the probe fails closed toward running, so a probe error or an unexpected errno still runs it.
