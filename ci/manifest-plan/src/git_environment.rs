//! Git commands that act on a repository this crate names explicitly.
//!
//! Git exports its repository-location variables to every hook and to every
//! `git rebase --exec` step. An inherited `GIT_DIR` takes precedence over both
//! `git -C` and the child's working directory, so a command meant for a named
//! repository acts on the caller's repository instead. In a scratch fixture
//! that means `git init` rewrites the caller's `core.bare` and a fixture commit
//! moves the caller's HEAD. That is what happened in
//! <https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3362>, when a rebase step ran this
//! crate's tests.
//!
//! Only the location variables are removed. `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` and its
//! companions carry this host's proxy rewrites and must survive.
