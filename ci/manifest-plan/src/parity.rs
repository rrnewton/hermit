//! Cross-backend parity cells: the data model, the selection file and the
//! committed snapshot.
//!
//! A parity cell compares one manifest test's `verify` run on a candidate
//! backend (kvm, liteinst, sabre or dbt) against the same test's `verify` run
//! on ptrace, the reference. A [`ParityCellId`] is therefore a test id plus a
//! candidate backend. It has no mode, because the mode is always `verify`,
//! and ptrace cannot be a member, because it is the reference. It is distinct
//! from [`crate::runner::CellId`], which names one run rather than a
//! comparison between two.
//!
//! The matrix is derived, never hand-written: every manifest test crossed with
//! the four candidate backends. A cell is
//!
//! - APPLICABLE when `verify` is enabled on both ptrace and the candidate, and
//! - SELECTABLE when it is applicable and both of those `verify` cells are
//!   selected by full validation (`Population::Required`). A test's lane is a
//!   property of the test rather than of the backend, so the two cells are then
//!   in the same validate plan.
//!
//! Every cell that falls short carries the manifest's own reason.
//! [`PARITY_SELECTION_PATH`] names the cells the parity report measures, and
//! [`PARITY_CELLS_PATH`] is the generated snapshot of every cell's status.
//!
//! [`post_pass`] is the one mechanism that measures parity, in validate and in
//! pressure-test alike. It runs after the determinism cells, inside the
//! harness process (validate) or the pressure-test process once every cell of
//! the series has finished, and reads only the logs those cells retained: for each
//! cell in scope it compares the ptrace golden with the candidate's log using
//! `hermit log-diff` and writes one [`ParityRecord`] to `parity.jsonl`. It runs
//! no guest and never changes a determinism result or an exit status. See
//! <https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3301>.
//!
//! Equal inputs. The ptrace and candidate cells of one test run from
//! different cell directories, and handing their guests those host paths
//! gives them different HOME, fixture and program paths, which alone make
//! ptrace diverge from ptrace. The runner therefore binds each verify cell's
//! input directories to the same guest paths below
//! [`crate::runner::EQUALIZED_INPUT_ROOT`] and names only those paths to the
//! guest. Every [`ParityRecord`] says whether the two runs were given equal
//! inputs, decided from how both were launched ([`inputs_equalized`]), and
//! credit from a comparison whose inputs were not equalized is reported apart
//! from clean credit (see [`ParityRecord::unequalized_credit`]). A backend
//! that cannot be given the reference's inputs at all reports
//! [`ParityVerdict::InputsNotEqualized`] instead of credit.
