"""Rebuild the e2e result files of a Buck test run from its Tpx results.

usage: ingest.py --plan ci/expected-e2e-plan.json --out IMPORT_DIR [--work DIR]
                 [--local-artifacts BUCK_OUT_TEST_DIR] [--failed-verify-logs DIR]
                 TEST_RUN_ID...

TEST_RUN_ID is what `buck2 test --write-test-id FILE` wrote (one per invocation; the
hybrid run makes two, one for RE cells and one for local cells). Every cell execution
uploads the rows test-harness wrote as its results.jsonl Tpx artifact; this fetches
them with testx (TESTX env, default `testx`) and writes one bucket per (lane, category):

    IMPORT_DIR/<lane>/manifest_<category>/results.jsonl

    IMPORT_DIR/<lane>/manifest_<category>/summary.json

IMPORT_DIR is input for `test-harness run` in import mode (E2E_IMPORT_RESULTS=IMPORT_DIR)
and for nothing else. Import mode checks every cell's history, staleness and evidence,
then publishes the result files the cargo flow's e2e nodes write. Read directly, these
files skip all of those checks, and summary.json's counts leave out every cell whose
final execution wrote no summary.json.
summary.json aggregates each cell's final execution: counts are summed and cell lists
joined, which is what one harness process over the bucket writes.
summary.json's evidence_complete_executions lists each execution whose result.json
(written by cell.sh) records complete evidence, by its run id; import mode refuses a
PASS whose own execution is not listed. An execution's rows, result.json and run_id.
marker (see --local-artifacts) must name one run id, and no two executions may share one.
Tpx owns retries (cells run the harness with --no-retry). A cell's Nth execution in Tpx
order is attempt N, and its row (at most one, for its own cell) carries that number. An
execution that wrote no row still takes its number, so the next row shows the gap and
import mode refuses the history. "Passed only on rerun" therefore stays visible, as
attempt 1 failing before attempt 2 passes, even when attempt 1 died before writing a row.
A cell with no rows is host-inapplicable only if it ran and every one of its executions
says so in its own summary.json. Any other plan cell with no rows is an error, and so is
a cell outside the plan. Executions of one cell that end in the same second are refused:
their order is unknown, and testx addresses an artifact as RUN.TEST.END. Prints one
JSON summary line.

Import mode's parity post-pass compares each verify cell's first-run log (the one hermit
keeps as the golden copy) with ptrace's. A row records the --verify-log-dir its cell ran
with, in scratch space that is gone; cell.sh returned that directory's files as
artifacts (cell__<path below the row's artifact_dir, / as __>__<file>, .zst when
compressed). Every run1_log_ file directly in it is checked byte-exact against the
sha256 its result.json recorded, decompressed, and written to

    IMPORT_DIR/retained-verify-logs/<run id>/<path below the row's artifact_dir>/

IMPORT_DIR/retained-verify-logs/index.jsonl maps each recorded directory to the
directory below IMPORT_DIR its logs were restored to, or to why none were (no such log
among the artifacts, a failed fetch, no recorded or a different sha256). A directory is
restored whole or not at all. A log that is not restored leaves only its parity cell
unmeasured: it never fails the ingest. Each entry also records where the execution that
recorded the directory ran, as its result.json recorded it: route (local or re),
container (pinned-root or empty) and re_platform, each null when it recorded none or
several executions recorded the directory. The post-pass gives a pair clean credit only
when both cells ran on the same route.

--failed-verify-logs DIR: keep the verify logs of every execution that did not pass, as
evidence that outlives IMPORT_DIR (validate passes a directory below its E2E result
root). An execution did not pass when its row is not PASS, when it wrote no row, or when
its result.json does not record complete evidence (cell.sh then reports it to Tpx as an
ERROR, whatever its row says). Each
of hermit's verify logs (run1_log_*, and run2_log_*, which hermit keeps only when the
two runs differ) that cell.sh returned from anywhere in the cell's directory is checked
byte-exact against the sha256 its result.json recorded, decompressed, and written to

    DIR/<run id>/<path below the cell's directory>/<log>

An execution that passed gets nothing here. A log is bounded the way the cargo lane's
retained logs are: hermit already stops a log at HERMIT_LOG_MAX_BYTES (1 GiB by default)
and appends its truncation marker, and this keeps at most 1 GiB + 1 MiB of a log, so a
log hermit bounded is kept whole and anything longer is cut there. DIR/index.jsonl has
one line per execution that did not pass: its cell, run id, outcome (null without a
row), route keys as above, and for each log the file written (relative to DIR) with its
size and whether it was cut, or why it was not kept. DIR must be absent, empty, or a
previous ingest's (it holds index.jsonl), and must neither contain nor lie inside IMPORT_DIR,
--work or --local-artifacts; it is replaced. The logs are kept before the cells' coverage is
checked, so a run that ingest refuses for a cell with no row (every attempt died) still
leaves them. A log that is not kept never fails the ingest.

--local-artifacts: Buck materializes each test's artifact directory locally
(buck-out/v2/test/execution/<cell>/<target hash>/<config hash>/default/artifacts_directory),
keeping the newest execution per target. cell.sh writes an artifact named run_id.<run id>,
which the testx listing shows without a fetch. An execution is read from the one local
directory holding its marker; every other execution, including one whose marker is in
no local directory or in several, is fetched with testx.
