"""Rebuild the e2e result files of a Buck test run from its Tpx results.

usage: ingest.py --plan ci/expected-e2e-plan.json --out IMPORT_DIR [--work DIR]
                 [--local-artifacts BUCK_OUT_TEST_DIR] TEST_RUN_ID...

TEST_RUN_ID is what `buck2 test --write-test-id FILE` wrote (one per invocation; the
hybrid run makes two, one for RE cells and one for local cells). Every cell execution
uploads the rows test-harness wrote as its results.jsonl Tpx artifact; this fetches
them with testx (TESTX env, default `testx`) and writes one bucket per (lane, category):

    IMPORT_DIR/<lane>/manifest_<category>/results.jsonl

    IMPORT_DIR/<lane>/manifest_<category>/summary.json

IMPORT_DIR is input for `test-harness run` in import mode (E2E_IMPORT_RESULTS=IMPORT_DIR)
and for nothing else. Import mode checks every cell's history, staleness and evidence,
then publishes the result files the cargo flow's e2e nodes write. Read directly, these
files skip all of those checks, and summary.json's counts leave out every cell whose
final execution wrote no summary.json.
summary.json aggregates each cell's final execution: counts are summed and cell lists
joined, which is what one harness process over the bucket writes.
summary.json's evidence_complete_executions lists each execution whose result.json
(written by cell.sh) records complete evidence, by its run id; import mode refuses a
PASS whose own execution is not listed. An execution's rows, result.json and run_id.
marker (see --local-artifacts) must name one run id, and no two executions may share one.
Tpx owns retries (cells run the harness with --no-retry). A cell's Nth execution in Tpx
order is attempt N, and its row (at most one, for its own cell) carries that number. An
execution that wrote no row still takes its number, so the next row shows the gap and
import mode refuses the history. "Passed only on rerun" therefore stays visible, as
attempt 1 failing before attempt 2 passes, even when attempt 1 died before writing a row.
A cell with no rows is host-inapplicable only if it ran and every one of its executions
says so in its own summary.json. Any other plan cell with no rows is an error, and so is
a cell outside the plan. Executions of one cell that end in the same second are refused:
their order is unknown, and testx addresses an artifact as RUN.TEST.END. Prints one
JSON summary line.

--local-artifacts: Buck materializes each test's artifact directory locally
(buck-out/v2/test/execution/<cell>/<target hash>/<config hash>/default/artifacts_directory),
keeping the newest execution per target. cell.sh writes an artifact named run_id.<run id>,
which the testx listing shows without a fetch. An execution is read from the one local
directory holding its marker; every other execution, including one whose marker is in
no local directory or in several, is fetched with testx.
