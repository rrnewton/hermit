# sync-cell-config.sh — regenerate everything a backend cell flip derives.
#
# A cell flip makes one existing manifest cell (test, mode, backend) required:
# in tests/e2e/manifests/<category>.yaml its backend joins the mode's
# `backends_enabled` and `ci` map (dropping its `backends_disabled` reason), or
# its `ci: false` becomes true. That manifest edit is the only hand edit. This
# script then rewrites, in dependency order,
#
#   test-harness sync-cells      ci/expected-e2e-plan.json, ci/optional-e2e-cells.txt,
#                                tests/e2e/parity-selection.yaml
#   generate-parity-cells        ci/compat-envelope/parity-cells.json
#   scorecard.rs update          SCORECARD.md, ci/compat-envelope/cells.json
#   generate-validation-dag      ci/dag/validate.json
#   generate-test-footprints     checked only; a flip does not move a footprint
#
# The diff of ci/expected-e2e-plan.json is the record of the change to the
# required cells; validation refuses any of these files that drifts from its
# generator (https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3606).

Usage: ci/sync-cell-config.sh [--check]

Regenerate every file derived from the E2E manifests after a cell flip: the
expected plan, the optional-cell inventory, the parity selection, parity-cells.json, the scorecard and cell
table, and the validation DAG. Edit the manifest, run this,
and commit the manifest with the files it rewrites.

Options:
  --check      Write nothing; exit 1 naming each step whose files are stale
  -h, --help   Print this help

Each step runs under its own timeout. Exit status: 0 when every file is
current (--check) or was regenerated, 1 when a step is stale, refused, failed
or timed out, 2 for a usage error.

Environment:
  CARGO_TARGET_DIR   Where the generators are built (default: <checkout>/target)
