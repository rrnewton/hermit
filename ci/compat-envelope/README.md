# Compatibility scorecard

Hermit owns the catalogue of manifest-declared test, mode, and backend
combinations and their selection/applicability reasons. Start at
[`SCORECARD.md`](../../SCORECARD.md); the same stable identities live in
[`cells.json`](cells.json). Schema 9 contains this selection data and a reference
to the existing [hermit_test_ledger](https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit_test_ledger)
repository, not accumulated run observations.

Detailed observations remain in that repository's `scorecard/cells.json`, using
the existing history decoder and result/provenance fields. Raw validation
results remain retained by their producer and are published through the parent
workspace's ledger pipeline. A missing ledger is reported as **history
unavailable**, never as zero measurements. Catalogue checks and test selection
do not require the history checkout.

The transition preserves the exact old Hermit `cells.json` in
`scorecard/legacy/<original-Git-blob>.json`, with its source commit, path, hash,
byte count and observation count in an adjacent identity file. `export-legacy`
copies the original bytes without normalizing old fields or inventing dates,
hosts or attempts. `update` refuses to remove that old document until this exact
archive is committed in the ledger. Existing Hermit Git history is unchanged.

Read the preserved document at the published ledger commit, without changing
the current history projection:

```console
git -C /path/to/hermit_test_ledger show <ledger-commit>:scorecard/legacy/<original-Git-blob>.identity.json
git -C /path/to/hermit_test_ledger show <ledger-commit>:scorecard/legacy/<original-Git-blob>.json > /path/to/legacy-cells.json
sha256sum /path/to/legacy-cells.json
```

Compare the digest and byte count with the identity file. The original JSON
retains all legacy fields and can be read using the existing history schema.
The archive is separate from the richer current ledger document: differences
between aggregate observation bodies do not establish distinct executions.
Legacy aggregates without a safe attempt identity remain readable here but are
not automatically merged, counted in rankings, or assigned timeline dates.

Later catalogue changes refresh the current history projection without
rewriting observations for identities that remain. New identities start
unmeasured. Retired identities may leave that projection only when its exact
previous document is committed in ledger Git history; an uncommitted document
refuses retirement. Selection changes do not fabricate a result or timestamp.

The denominator is the complete comparable manifest matrix, not just the
combinations selected by one validate path. For `N` manifest tests, verify,
replay, and chaos span five Hermit backends, while native contributes one
naked-execution control: `N × (5 × 3 + 1)` cells. Native is shown as a sixth
backend in the table, but it does not have replay or chaos cells, so the formula
is not `N × 6 × 3`. Explicit `custom` commands still run when selected by
ordinary validation, but they are not multiplied across every test/backend
pair: unlike the three common modes, they do not define a uniform product-wide
denominator.

This is the catalogue's population, not the website's backend-ranking
denominator. Backend comparison percentages use the distinct test-and-mode
population actually recorded Green on ptrace. Missing backend evidence stays
in that common population and earns no comparison credit.

For one dated example only: on 2026-08-13, `N = 336`, so the comparable matrix
has `336 × (5 × 3 + 1) = 5,376` cells. The checked-in table is generated from
the live manifest and changes automatically when a manifest test is added.

`hermit-manifest-plan --format matrix-json` emits every cell in the manifest,
including applicable and not-applicable combinations. It also emits the
validated per-test timeout and the number of
`execute_attempt` calls the existing harness makes for each mode. A seedless
chaos mode has `attempts: null`: it remains red but has no command to run. The
pressure-test entry point consumes this output instead of parsing the manifest
a second way. A disabled combination is not applicable. The existing `--format
json` and text views remain execution-only because
they are execution plans rather than scorecards.

## Ordinary validation

Run:

```console
./validate.sh
```

The path is deliberately direct:

1. `hermit-manifest-plan` validates the complete matrix and emits the execution
   plan selected by the requested path.
2. `ci/expected-e2e-plan.json` identifies the cells ordinary validation runs.
3. Each manifest bucket appends schema-4 `results.jsonl` rows to a unique
   durable result directory. Every row includes the validate attempt number,
   cell `duration_ms`, the `timeout_seconds` used for that attempt, literal
   argv, explicit environment, working directory, and pasteable shell command.
   The framework also writes the existing pressure `result` value and an
   explicit `failure_class`; `error_kind` remains the narrower mechanism. A
   retry adds another row rather than replacing the earlier observation, so a
   change such as `determinism-failure` then `crash-error` is retained.
   `attempts[].cpu_usage_usec` records `wait4` user-plus-system CPU for that
   launched child and descendants it reaped. The row-level `cpu_usage_usec`
   adds preparation and every launched attempt with checked arithmetic; it is
   null when execution did not occur or any required measurement is incomplete.
   The bucket `summary.json` field `cell_cpu_usage_usec` likewise sums every
   emitted applicable row, including failed rows followed by retries.
4. The final `scorecard.compatibility` node requires a clean, exact-HEAD PASS
   row for every selected cell and prints the table.
5. The checked-in table and cell identities must still equal what the manifest
   and expected plan derive. After receipt work, ordinary validation calls the
   existing parent `ci-hub/series/mirror.py` publisher. It publishes raw series
   and updates the detailed scorecard inside the existing ledger repository;
   it does not rewrite Hermit's catalogue or create a second history store.
   Publication failure remains visible and leaves the original results retained.

6. A top-level full run retains `ignored/validate/artifacts/<run-id>/coverage.json`.
   It names the exact plan and outer nodes, every selected E2E cell, every
   cell in the manifest not selected by that path, with its recorded reason
   and any available historical pass/fail counts, and the complete integration-test-binary registration
   partition. The ledger row carries the same counts and binds the artifact by
   SHA-256. When the manifest input is a catalogue rather than a history document,
   historical counts are null with `history_available: false`; current run
   results and their denominator remain separate.

`./scripts/validate.rs --show-plan` lists outer DAG nodes only. It does not list
the Rust test IDs or E2E cells inside those nodes; `coverage.json` records the
E2E population after a full run, while exact per-plan Rust test-ID enumeration
remains unavailable.

`SCORECARD.md` reports the current regression-cell count and lists the exact
selected custom commands separately. Explicit custom commands remain required
validation checks even though they are outside this uniform comparable
denominator. `scorecard.rs check` refuses unless every selected row is accounted
for by either the comparable green cells or that custom-command list.

Selection alone establishes neither determinism nor parity. The website reads
the retained typed comparison evidence: canonical repeat comparisons establish
determinism, while explicit comparisons between ptrace and another backend
establish cross-backend parity. A same-backend `bitwise_parity` result cannot
substitute for that second comparison. Historical rows lacking the required
evidence remain unavailable for the corresponding metric.

Scorecard selection records whether a cell in the manifest is selected by full.
Measurement is separate: importing a pass or divergence records what happened
without changing which cells validation selects. Moving a cell out of the
selected plan is not a fix, and `scorecard.rs update` refuses that plan removal
unless an explicit compatibility-standard transition requests it.

See every command and the exact green definition with:

```console
./ci/compat-envelope/scorecard.rs --help
```

## Updating the checked-in table

After deliberately adding a cell to `ci/expected-e2e-plan.json`, run:

```console
./ci/compat-envelope/scorecard.rs update
git diff -- SCORECARD.md ci/compat-envelope/cells.json
./validate.sh
```

Review the table delta and the exact cell identity. The update command does not
run a test and cannot change measurement by itself. The following validate
automatically records any canonical per-cell results after its ledger and
receipt work; selection alone is not evidence.

## Cells not selected by full and the periodic full-matrix run

Every applicable manifest cell outside the full plan is not selected by full.
Other cells are not applicable. A cell not selected by full can have a passing
measurement, and a selected cell can have a divergence; selection and
measurement answer different questions.

To measure a not-applicable backend population before changing its manifest
applicability, name the backend explicitly. The backend requirement prevents an
unfiltered probe from attempting every unsupported combination:

```console
./ci/compat-envelope/pressure-test.rs run \
  --probe-disabled --backend kvm --mode verify --repetitions 1 \
  --cell-timeout 60 --run-timeout 7200
```

These probes use the harness's existing `--probe-disabled` execution path and
retain the backend filter in `run.json`. They do not change cell status or
manifest selection; a later reviewed change may select only cells supported by
the measured evidence.

## Divergence positions: where a cell diverged, and how well you know it

A red cell should say WHERE it diverged, not only that it did. Each observation
carries the position as a range per coordinate:

```json
"first_divergent_scheduler_turn": { "earliest": 1, "latest": 4, "samples": 2 }
```

**`samples` is the number of runs that LOCATED a position**, and it is stored
rather than derived because the plausible denominators disagree. In the
scorecard's own self-test bracket, five folded rows collapse to four distinct
invocations of which only three located anything: a passing run and a timing-out
run contribute no bound. "Earliest 80, latest 500" is a different claim over two
runs than over fifty, so the bounds are not interpretable without it. A range
with `samples: 1` is a POINT, not a distribution.

**`provenance` says which mechanism produced the bounds**, and the two are never
merged:

| provenance | what it runs | what its bounds mean |
|---|---|---|
| `hermit-repeat` | a cell repeatedly at one tree | the runs requested directly through `hermit-repeat` |
| `pressure-test` | a cell repeatedly at one tree | the flake distribution — what a yellow-cell floor should be derived from |
| `validate` | a cell once per commit | a point; the regression signal a floor is checked against |

Merging them would give one number that moves for two unrelated causes — "the
code changed" and "this varies run to run". Observations are therefore keyed by
`(detcore_tree, provenance)`. Keying by tree already stopped bounds mixing
across code changes; provenance closes the remaining axis.

Both coordinates above are the position of the PRECEDING scheduler COMMIT, so
they **bound** the divergence rather than locating it: in a 131-line log with
six COMMIT records, every divergence between two of them reports the same turn.

### Writing observations

These scorecard commands write the arrays. `update-observations`,
`import-results`, `project-observations`, and `observe-results` are available
explicitly. A completed top-level validation instead asks the parent publisher
to run `project-and-observe-results` as one transaction after finalization.

Run these commands from the Hermit repository root. Explicit observation
commands automatically use the same parent publisher as ordinary validation.
The publisher owns its existing linked ledger writer and publication lock;
setting `DEV_HERMIT_TEST_LEDGER_ROOT` alone grants no write access. Read-only
commands use that override or the parent's `hermit_test_ledger` checkout.
The canonical series directory is `hermit_test_ledger/series` in that repository.

`scorecard-series-snapshot/v1` now optionally records `source.repository`, and
its flattened observation projection records `source_repository`. New records
name the ledger URL exactly. Missing repository fields retain their historical
meaning: the commit/tree belongs to dev-hermit, not the ledger. Producer Hermit
and Reverie code identities and explicit determinism/parity evidence are unchanged.
The publisher supplies the ledger writer's absolute `series` path. For a manual
read, resolve `--series-root` relative to the current directory.

```console
./ci/compat-envelope/scorecard.rs update-observations --summary FILE   # pressure test
./ci/compat-envelope/scorecard.rs observe-results --results DIR        # validate
./ci/compat-envelope/scorecard.rs import-results \
  --results DIR --current-summary FILE [--current-summary FILE ...]
./ci/compat-envelope/scorecard.rs project-observations \
  --series-root ../hermit_test_ledger/series --refreshed-at STAMP                         # series
```

`project-observations` records the selected source as a canonical
repository-relative path together with the exact commit and Git tree object
whose series rows it projected. Different paths to the same ledger checkout
record the same repository URL and checkout-independent `series` identity.
It snapshots the committed JSONL shard population and bytes, then refuses a
worktree with changed, missing, or untracked shards. Git replacement refs are
ignored so the recorded object IDs and read tree cannot disagree.
Malformed rows or shards without their final newline, read-invalid rows, and
conflicting bodies under one `event_id` are also refusals. Semantically
identical repeats of an event collapse to one canonical row, which is what
`rows_read` counts. Projection blocks written before `source_commit` or
`source_tree` existed remain readable, but consumers cannot qualify them until
they are regenerated with the immutable source identity.

`observe-results` walks every `results.jsonl` under `DIR`, so several runs fold
in one invocation — which is how a validate-side range widens beyond a point.
Local validation supplies only its finalized run ID to the parent publisher.
The publisher queries the canonical terminal row, snapshots the committed
series, and supplies both to `project-and-observe-results` under its ledger
publication lock. The transaction checks the producer's original raw-input
census, including empty files and superseded attempts, and the retained plan,
cell, and test evidence before replacing the two detailed scorecard files.
An empty current result directory requires verified zero cell selection and
complete test evidence; directory emptiness alone cannot establish that result.
The publisher requeries the canonical row before committing the derived update.

Canonical `--only` selections in the quick, full, portable, and hosted-portable
graphs retain their exact `only-*` profile and constructed subset. They can
publish verified zero manifest cells alongside actual package-test results;
they do not become full-profile validation receipts. Census authority requires
the source-defined normal launch shapes and completed known raw writers. A
custom or incomplete writer leaves an explicit census error while preserving
its ordinary native results and captured raw evidence.

Raw series delivery and derived publication have separate outcomes. A refused
derived write preserves the original results and does not change the validation
verdict, but the publication command remains nonzero. Only the parent publisher
commits the ledger updates; it never copies observations back into the measured
Hermit checkout. Nested and off-the-record validations do not request this
finalized scorecard publication. Explicit `observe-results` keeps its existing
unchanged-success behavior for a no-result directory and requires the inherited
publication lock and a clean measured source.

The scorecard writer cannot change which cells are selected or move their
green/red state.
`import-results` walks retained history without executing a guest, keeps only
clean schema-4 `BitwiseInfoV1` terminal comparisons from commits on `HEAD`'s
history, and selects the newest such commit independently for every applicable
cell. If several retained runs at that commit disagree, it imports every result
instead of resolving the conflict by file order.

A retained comparison without a divergence position is imported as historical
evidence with its own SHA. A retained position is handled only after a current
pressure summary classifies it: FRESH imports the matching retained position;
DRIFTED replaces it with the current position; WRONG discards it because the
current comparison matches; UNCHECKABLE withholds it because the current row
did not establish a trustworthy result. Each outcome is printed per cell.
One matching run is UNCHECKABLE rather than WRONG because these cells can match
once and diverge on another run. WRONG requires at least two distinct current
runs and no divergence; every classification prints the run count it used.

The writers refuse unrelated tracked changes. `import-results` may replace its
own two generated outputs so the same retained corpus can be imported again.
`observe-results` additionally refuses rows that are not clean at `HEAD`;
`import-results` preserves each historical row's SHA and Detcore tree instead
of relabelling it as current.
`ERROR` rows are reported but not recorded as product behaviour. Neither
pressure-test nor validate observations change scorecard colour.

Current pressure summaries may come from separate clean worktrees. The import
requires each named Hermit commit to exist, requires its recorded Detcore tree
to match that commit, and requires the same Detcore tree as the one being
classified. One DBT case is narrower than the ordinary pressure writer: when
the sole evidence error is that the raw run1/run2 logs were not retained, a
typed canonical, non-vacuous `verdict=diverged` report can supply the current
divergence position. The ordinary pressure writer still refuses that row, and
the import refuses any additional evidence error, matched report, or weaker
comparison.

The historical `never-measured` value in `cells.json` means no observation was
imported. It is not proof that the cell was never run; retained results can
exist before this projection is refreshed.

The series cell name is the exact `test/mode/backend` identity. Passing and
diverging comparisons create observations and update `last_tested`; compressed
`num_runs` rows contribute their full sample count to any recorded divergence
position. `no_result`, `timeout`, `errored`, and `skipped` rows are named but do
not become evidence. Historical rows that predate the `detcore_tree` field use
their exact recorded Hermit commit as a distinct internal grouping key and
never consult the projection checkout's refs or object store. Scorecard schema
7 represents that legacy case as an observation with no `detcore_tree` and
exactly one recorded `hermit_shas` entry. It cannot alias an explicit
Detcore-tree observation, and it does not update `last_tested`, whose staleness
check requires a real Detcore tree. Older scorecards remain readable. A row is
skipped for identity only when it records neither a valid explicit Detcore tree
nor a valid Hermit commit.

This projection does not import retained validate result directories. That is
a separate input path even though both ultimately update the same observation
fields.

During investigation, probe one exact red cell with a tight wall-clock cap:

```console
./ci/compat-envelope/pressure-test.rs run \
  --test applications/example-timed-progress-bar \
  --mode verify --backend ptrace --cell-timeout 60
```

For a reproducible bounded sample across verify, replay, and chaos, run:

```console
./ci/compat-envelope/pressure-test.rs run \
  --sample 10 --seed 42 --cell-timeout 60
```

Add `--mode verify` to sample only the first improvement target. Custom commands
and native naked controls are not part of an unqualified random sample. The
seed and every selected identity are retained in `run.json`.
Chaos cells whose manifests declare no seeds remain red but are not executable.
An exact request refuses before creating a plan; a batch reports and omits
those cells instead of inventing a default seed or recording a zero-execution
failure. The scorecard denominator is unchanged.

Generate the same graph without executing it by replacing `run` with `plan`
and supplying `--results DIR`. A request for every red cell is accepted only
when its declared worst-case occupancy fits `--run-timeout`; otherwise the tool
refuses and tells the caller to select a bounded sample or deliberately provide
a larger wall-clock bound. It does not pretend that thousands of cells fit in
the two-hour default.

The current improvement sequence starts with verify. A verify-only sample does
not change its denominator or green definition:

```console
./ci/compat-envelope/pressure-test.rs run \
  --mode verify --sample 10 --seed 42 --cell-timeout 60
```

The command reuses the canonical Hermit/resource build nodes, serializes
fixture preparation, and gives every red cell its own cgroup-boxed node.
The plan derives that build closure from the selected cells: a sample without
LiteInst does not build the LiteInst runtime, while any sample containing a
LiteInst cell retains the complete canonical LiteInst build chain.
`run` first materializes the exact committed SHA in a temporary local clone,
so ignored Cargo output in the primary checkout cannot change the experiment
and no shared worktree registry is touched. The generated clone is removed
afterward while the run directory remains retained.
Applicable cells not selected by full use the ordinary exact-cell selector;
not-applicable cells use the harness's explicit `--probe-disabled` selector.
Each cell gets at most the
shipped portable DAG's existing 600-second bucket allowance; the manifest's
smaller per-cell timeout still applies inside it. Expected nonzero exits,
timeouts, OOMs, and no-result outcomes stay red but do not stop later cells. If the
cgroup runner itself stops after a bounded cell is killed, the command keeps a
conservative attempt marker and starts another DAG pass; completed builds,
preparations, and cells are not repeated. KVM cells retain the canonical
privileged DAG's 16 GiB hard cap even when their manifest lane is portable. A
malformed published per-cell artifact, or a missing artifact without a
narrowly proven runner timeout or OOM, becomes an infrastructure-error row;
the tool finishes the table and writes `summary.json`, then returns nonzero
rather than claiming a complete population. The retained runner profile is
what distinguishes an OOM or boxed cell timeout from an ordinary nonzero
harness exit. A timeout requires either that exact runner row plus the attempt marker,
or the test harness's separate GNU-timeout signal report plus its named
per-cell timeout result; exit 124 alone is not timeout evidence. Cell results
are published from an `in-progress` path only after the harness returns; that
path is never terminal evidence, so an empty file created before a runner kill
cannot masquerade as a malformed terminal result. The combined `crash-error`
result contains remaining nonzero harness
exits, including signal-caused crashes when the shell reports a nonzero status;
the pressure runner does not currently distinguish the originating signal. A
missing result, verification report, or retained log is accepted only when an
exact-SHA, exact-step runner row records an OOM kill and the cell's numeric
attempt marker exists. Any artifact that does exist must still parse and match
the selected cell.

The ignored run directory retains `dag.json`, `run.json`, captured per-cell
stdout/stderr, result rows, runner profiles, and `summary.json`. Verify-mode
attempts also retain both raw INFO logs named by Hermit. A ptrace verify attempt
runs the same Hermit binary's one-input `log-diff` command and retains the
normalized first-run INFO stream for later cross-backend parity work. Retaining
that input is preparation, not a parity result.
Replay-mode raw-log retention is not implemented yet. A one-time PASS is
printed as a candidate for repeated confirmation; it never edits the tracked
green set automatically.
See the complete command contract with:

```console
./ci/compat-envelope/pressure-test.rs --help
```

This ports the useful one-box-per-red-cell shape from the old parent-workspace
`compat-envelope/expansion-dag.rs`. It deliberately does not port the parent
CSV dependency, invented fallback backend multipliers, or evidence-directory
deletion.

After a clean periodic run, deliberately merge its red-cell measurements with:

```console
./ci/compat-envelope/scorecard.rs update-observations \
  --summary ignored/compat-envelope/pressure-<SHA>-<time>/summary.json
# The parent publisher reports the ledger commit; Hermit cells.json is unchanged.
```

The command requires the summary's Hermit commit and Detcore tree to equal the
clean checkout at `HEAD`, refuses infrastructure-error rows, and updates only
red-cell observations. For repeated measurements of the same Detcore tree, it
retains the exact Hermit commits measured, every observed result, and the
earliest and latest first-divergence scheduler turn and virtual nanosecond. A
determinism, replay, or parity failure with no measurable divergence point
keeps null fields; it does not get a guessed number. A new Detcore tree gets a
separate observation. Neither this command nor ordinary green regression
validation changes the green set.
