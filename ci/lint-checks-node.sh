# CI node entrypoint for `make lint-checks`.
#
# WHY THIS WRAPPER EXISTS: the target's checkers need initialized submodules --
# ci/verify-submodules.sh inspects them directly, and run-reverie-pin-check.sh and
# check-nested-lockfiles.rs both run under $(SUBMODULE_PROXY) against the pinned
# trees. A freshly created linked worktree has NO submodules initialized, so
# verify-submodules.sh reports a leading '-' inventory and exits 1.
#
# That exit is a SETUP condition, not a product failure, and letting it land as a
# `fail` is the third-state bug: an abort that reads like a failure. scripts/
# validate.rs:5362 reserves exit 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL) as "the only nonzero code that is
# not a product failure"; outcome_is_no_result() classifies it `no_result` and
# outcome_is_failure() excludes it. ci/run-with-reverie-dbt-budget.sh already uses
# 75 for its pin-mismatch refusal, so this follows the established spelling rather
# than inventing one. Every other nonzero exit from the target stays loud.
#
# The distinction is load-bearing in practice, not hypothetical: an agent hit this
# exact abort in a fresh worktree on 2026-08-25 and had to reason it out by hand to
# call it environment rather than a red.

# to verify-submodules.sh and be reported as an ordinary failure -- classifying
# those as no_result would silence exactly the drift the checker exists to catch.

# ⚠️ THE PARENT-ADAPTER PRECONDITION IS CLASSIFIED AFTER THE TARGET RUNS, NOT BEFORE.
# An earlier version exited 75 HERE, before `make lint-checks`, and so skipped every
# checker in the target -- 17 of them -- for a precondition that affects one arm of
# one case in one of them. It shipped saying "Every other checker in this target is
# unaffected and would have run", which was false: none of them ran. That is worse
# than the false main-red it was fixing, and it landed one day after this node was
# created precisely so those checkers would be gated by construction.
#
# So: run the whole target. If the target SUCCEEDED but something announced itself
# unevaluated on a line starting with the machine-readable prefix, the run as a
# whole is a no_result: everything that could be checked was checked and passed,
# and something could not be checked.
#
# The canonical adapter accept arm is NO LONGER one of those announcements. This
# node runs in lanes with no dev-hermit parent (hosted-portable on every GitHub
# runner), and an arm that can never be evaluated in a lane made this node a
# permanent no_result there, which the hosted gate reads as red: that was
# https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/actions/runs/36550265580. The target now runs
# scripts/test_validate_stop_paths.py --exclude-canonical-adapter-accept-arm, which
# prints that the arm is NOT COVERED by this run and where it is. The arm is its
# own DAG node, check.canonical_adapter_accept, labelled `full` only -- the lane
# whose checkouts sit under the parent -- where a missing parent is still exit 75
# and a failure is still a failure. The exclude mode itself refuses unless that
# node is present, is the only owner of the arm, is `full`-only, and runs the
# script directly rather than through make.
#
# Any real failure still propagates unchanged -- a nonzero from make is a failure,
# never a no_result, because a no_result must not be able to swallow a red.
#
# ⚠️ WHY 75 AND NOT A NEW CODE. scripts/validate.rs recognises exactly one no-result
# value -- NO_RESULT_EXIT_CODE = 75, matched by outcome_is_no_result() and excluded
# by outcome_is_failure() -- so any other number is classified a FAILURE and would
# reintroduce the false main-red. The code space has one slot. (The general rule
# about not collapsing two conditions into one code is stated in
# ci-hub/bin/gh-merge-verified in the DEV-HERMIT PARENT repository; this repository
# has no ci-hub/ directory, so that path does not resolve from here.)

# THE CHECKERS RUN CONCURRENTLY. lint-checks is one make target per checker, so
# -j runs them side by side; serially the node's wall time was the sum of their
# CPU time (about 366 s, measured 2026-10-04). The DAG sets HERMIT_LINT_CHECK_JOBS
# to the node's CPU width.
#
# A run without it uses one job per checker, bounded by the cores and by memory
# (default_lint_jobs). Measured 2026-10-05 on devbig030 at 32e2d4bb3e, 44
# checkers: the node's anonymous memory peaked at 1.46 GB with -j8 and 4.18 GB
# with -j44, and the largest single checker process, in the lint-check-shellcheck
# recipe, reached 230 MiB. So each job is budgeted 256 MiB, against MemAvailable or,
# inside a cgroup with a memory.max, the room left under it.
#   -k        keep going, so every failing checker is reported, not only the first.
#   -Otarget  print each checker's output in one piece when it finishes. This is
#             what keeps a NO-RESULT-CASE marker at column 0 on its own line for
#             classify_run; interleaved output could split it.
# make names each failing target (`[Makefile:N: lint-check-<name>] Error 1`), and
# its exit status is still nonzero when any checker fails.
