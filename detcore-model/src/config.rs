/// blocking every SaBRe measurement.

///
/// Two encodings of `Config::default()` and the source definitions for the

/// - the exact legacy-bincode bytes used by Reverie RPC, which detect changes
///   such as `u32` to `u64` even when both default to JSON number zero; and
/// - the JSON encoding, which carries every field name and makes a pure rename
///   visible even though bincode is positional; and
/// - the source files defining `Config`, its local serialized field types,
///   `DetTime`, and the `RawInode` the inode RPCs carry, which catch
///   wire-incompatible changes hidden by a default such as `Option<u64>::None`
///   to `Option<u32>::None`, or an added clock or inode field that leaves both
///   encodings of `Config` unchanged.
///
/// The source and JSON domains are deliberately stricter than the wire format
/// strictly requires. A documentation-only edit in one of these files can

///   itself: refusing a non-leader exec is a typed refusal it reports per

///   `time(2)` probe and `Guest::storable_memory_ranges`, and the user
///   address limit is each guest's own `Guest::user_address_limit` report);
/// - every other key supplies the one capability of the same meaning.
///
/// This inverts [`to_legacy_backend_json`] for every capability value the keys
/// can express, which includes every backend's own constant except for

/// `record_host_inputs` does not, and read back as their default. There are
/// two, `process_exits_complete_asynchronously` and
/// `virtualizes_guest_sigalrm`, both true only for in-guest LiteInst, which
/// never travels through this DBT-only form.
///
/// `kvm_shared_dequeue_timers` supplies no capability. It was read into a
/// `Config` field that chose the controlled signal path, and that choice is
/// now made from the capabilities, [`Config::sequentialize_threads`] and the
/// control the backend offers. It is read as it was, a boolean that is false
/// when absent, and the parse then fails unless it equals `backend_is_kvm &&
/// sequentialize_threads`, the value the production launcher always wrote. An
/// accepted input whose capabilities are those of the backend that runs it
/// selects the path it selected before. An input that would select another,
/// such as `true` without `backend_is_kvm`, or absent beside `backend_is_kvm`
/// and sequentialized threads, fails the parse rather than being silently
/// reinterpreted. (`backend_is_kvm` given to a backend that offers no control,
/// such as DBT, already misdescribed that backend and stays outside this
/// guarantee; the production launcher never writes it.) A failed parse is
/// handled like any malformed value: the DBT runtime, the only production
/// reader, falls back to its strict default configuration and emits its
/// `could not parse HERMIT_DBT_DETCONFIG` warning.
///
/// Everything else is read as the legacy form was read, by `Config`'s own
/// derived deserializer with the legacy keys taken out before it sees them:
///
/// - In an object, a key the legacy form did not name is ignored, whatever its
///   value. `backend` is such a key, so it is ignored rather than read as the
///   field it is now; no production writer emits it. A key the legacy form
///   named fails the parse when it appears twice or holds the wrong type.
/// - A JSON array lists the fields by position, as serde reads any derived
///   struct. The positions are those of the legacy form, which are the key
///   order of [`to_legacy_backend_json`]: the fifteen legacy keys stand where
///   [`Config::backend`] stands. Too many elements fail the parse; too few
