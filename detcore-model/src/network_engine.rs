//! The pure state machine behind network record and replay.
//!
//! The engine models the guest-visible state of each outbound TCP channel:
//! which inbound bytes have been released to the guest, whether the peer
//! closed or reset the connection, how many bytes the guest transmitted, and
//! the receive low-water mark. It performs no I/O. The runtime asks it what a
//! guest `recv`, `poll` or `send` observes at a given global time, and in
//! record mode feeds it the bytes it pulled from the host.
//!
//! Determinism rests on the release rule of [`NetworkReleaseV1`]: an input
//! becomes visible once global time has reached the time at which the
//! recording first observed it *and* the guest has transmitted at least as
//! many bytes on that channel as it had by then. Both quantities are
//! functions of the guest's own deterministic execution, so a replay never
//! depends on host timing, and a replay that follows the recorded schedule
//! observes every input at the same check that the recording did.
//!
//! A blocking receive completes once enough bytes are available to satisfy
//! its target, all at once. Linux may copy a partial segment into the buffer
//! of a waiting reader before the rest arrives; the engine instead hands out
//! the bytes as if they had arrived together, which is one of the outcomes
//! Linux permits.
