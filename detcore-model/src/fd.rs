/// Nondeterministic "physical" inode: a host file's identity, its device and
/// its inode number on that device.
///
/// An inode number alone does not name a file: each filesystem numbers its own
/// inodes, so a file in `/sys` and one on the root filesystem can share a
/// number. Keyed by the number alone, Hermit gave two such files ONE
/// deterministic inode, so a guest comparing inode numbers could take them for
/// the same file, and which files merged depended on how the host happened to
/// number them.
///
/// The device is the one `stat` reports for the file. Linux does not always
/// report one device per file across interfaces: on btrfs, `stat` reports a
/// per-subvolume device while `/proc/*/maps` reports the superblock device,
/// and on overlayfs maps reports the lower file's device. This type does not
/// guess that such devices are equal; a caller holding another interface's
/// pair must find `stat`'s identity for the same file or key on the pair it
/// has, accepting that the two views mint different values. Detcore's
/// `mapping_stat_identity` does the former for a maps line from the `fstat`
/// identity recorded when the guest mapped the file, or else by resolving the
/// line's path, and keys on the maps pair only when neither names the file.
