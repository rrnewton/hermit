//! The host identity of a file a guest opened.
//!
//! Hermit maps each host inode it sees to a deterministic one in the order it
//! first sees them, so a host file that is REPLACED while a run is going (a
//! package manager rewriting `/etc/ld.so.cache` between the opens of two
//! guest processes, for example) gives that run one more inode than the other
//! run, and every later inode number differs. `hermit run --verify` then
//! reports a divergence that the guest did not cause. Each verification run
//! therefore records one [`HostInputRecord`] per host file the guest opens, in
//! a side file ([`crate::config::Config::host_input_log`]) written when the run
//! ends and never part of the compared log, and on a divergence the two runs'
//! records are compared to name such a change.
