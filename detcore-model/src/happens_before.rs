//! Happens-before edges: a sparse, authored partial order over dynamic events.
//!
//! Where `--replay-schedule-from` replays a *complete* total order captured from
//! a prior run, a happens-before specification pins down only the *few* events
//! that matter for a race and lets the deterministic scheduler fill in the rest.
//! An agent (or human) that already knows a target race can therefore construct
//! it deterministically instead of blind seed-search.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! An [`Anchor`] names a precise, deterministic per-thread stop point. Following
//! the owner's refinement of RFC #1146, the *primary* addressing is a
//! [`Position`] — "after N syscalls" or "after M retired conditional branches
//! (RCBs)" on a specific thread — optionally decorated with a [`CodeLocation`]
//! (function and/or source line, resolved from debug info) for readability. The
//! RFC's richer addressing modes (Nth occurrence of a named syscall, RIP hit, or
//! function entry) remain expressible but are deliberately *not* the lead
//! addressing scheme.
//!
//! A [`HappensBeforeEdge`] states that one anchor must be observed before another
//! thread is allowed to proceed past its anchor. A [`HappensBeforeSpec`] is the
//! whole authored partial order: a table of named threads, a table of named
//! events (anchors), and the edge list connecting them.
//!
//! This module owns the *model* only: parsing (JSON and a terse DSL),
//! normalization, and static validation (name resolution, exactly-one-position,
//! and cycle detection). Resolving a [`CodeLocation`] to a concrete address via
//! debug info, and enforcing edges in the scheduler, live in higher layers.

//   * `@0xADDR`         -> raw RIP
//   * `syscall@phase`   -> a named syscall, optional `@pre`/`@post`/`@polling`

// A trailing `#N` sets the occurrence ordinal (ignored by `rcb=`/`sc=`).
// A `!soft` suffix on the line marks the edge soft; default is hard.
